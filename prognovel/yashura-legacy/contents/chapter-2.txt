<p>
Dinner at Malikh Family.
</p>
<p>
As it was the first feast the sole daughter of family patriarch had in two years, the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. A good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. Although rare, this kind of extravagant wasn’t to Bhela Malikh’s liking--especially when they’d hold even a bigger feast the day after tomorrow in ngajen ceremony. If she given a choice she’d rather had a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.
</p>
<p>
Bhela saw the two maidservants who helped her in the training ground carried clay plates back and forth. It seemed they kept their mouth tight about their previous conversation and about the four arrows skill Bhela tested, as she found out the elders she was talking to were oblivious about somethings.
</p>
<p>
“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”
</p>
<p>
The elder said that with a flattering tone, but the smile didn’t reach his eyes. It was fake. Bhela wanted to ignore him, but she knew she couldn’t.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”
</p>
<p>
Usually, whether a dinner or bigger feast, people would have their seat on bamboo mats or carpets on the floor making groups and important family members would be hopping here and there to greet and make sure everyone would have a good time. But this time it was set in an uncomfortable way. Everyone seemed sitting toward her. Everyone kept showered fake flatteries and congratulations. Bhela kept nodding her head and tried as best as she could not to show her real feeling through her own fake smile. All in all, no one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.
</p>
<p>
In the end the bald Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch health. Although Bhela hadn’t coming home for two years she knew a bit about the opinions inside Malikh Family. She knew her father the family patriarch was unpopular mainly because her engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago. But the thing she found out after made a peek was horrified her inside. Almost none of the family members prayed seriously. Almost as if they didn’t care about their own patriarch who, in his young, fought in many dangerous battle along with his best friend from Yashura Family to secure village’s safety and the surrounding routes for peddler and merchants from bandit harassment.
</p>
<p>
The young lady looked down and bit her lips. The main reason her father lost his footing in family’s politic was precisely because of her. 
</p>
<p>
At first, when she was a child, no one really giving a damn about the engagement. She too, as she too absorbed by bows and arrows, wasn’t really put enough thought about the fact she didn’t have a choice to choose her own man in the future. But things began to change when she grew into a pretty young lady. She showed excellent talent and getting scouted to two-years series of seminars, everyone said her future would be very bright. At the time she wasn’t yet to realize it when some elders urged her father to null the engagement. She also didn’t realize when her father stubbornly shook his head against the popular complaints and little by little the criticism grew into resentment. Now, once again, looking at the indifferent people pretending to pray, Bhela’s heart grew cold. All this was because she was the most excellent young lady Malikh Family had. She was the most precious gem for them. And they didn’t want to give away their gem to--according to everyone--a trash of Yashura Family heir.

</p>
<p>
Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So his time alone usually free.
</p>
<p>
At night, his schedule when he was alone often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. On the wooden wall in his bedroom he put a lighten torch because he didn’t want to make his pocket suffer to buy safer lighting sources. Indoor lantern, especially wax candles, burnt for lighting as well his money. He prefered to save his spare wealth or put them on the motion by investing on a peddler connected with Yashura Family. So currently the room couldn’t be said well-lit. He kept painting despite of that. His eyes were decent in dim light and the quality of his drawing wasn’t differed much when he painted in the daylight. The lady on the canvas shyly stared with dreamy eyes. As if she was drunk by lust.
</p>
<p>
“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve show the boobs a little more.”
</p>
<p>
The boy’d be lying if he didn’t get his heart jumping from Good-Natured Spirit’s sudden appearance. He glared at the Nalaq as if he wanted to snarl. “Can you knock the door first?”
</p>
<p>
“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t creeping up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”
</p>
<p>
“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, the boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t push it, old man.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! You’re not fun anymore.”
</p>
<p>
In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and--according to him--still handsome as ever.
</p>
<p>
The two of them haggling for the next ten minutes. Because the danger of being discovered by the occasional visiting cousin, Shira didn’t have the nerve to draw a frontal nudity. But again the shameless Nalaq casually dropped a handful of coins--twice the amount Shira won this afternoon, yet his own conscience telling him if he was going to listen to Good-Natured Spirit’s request a bad luck would surely come for him.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, forget it. Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway,” the Nalaq said.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not this one. Too safe. I don’t want it. Make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”
</p>
<p>
Shira sighed and done it for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit said as he looked at the lady in painting, “Hmm. But I’ve got to say, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”
</p>
<p>
Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”
</p>
<p>
“You weren’t using your invisibility to take advantage of her, were you?” Shira asked with one of his eyebrows lifted.
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit snorted. “Of course not. Do you think I’m that kind of lowlife?”
</p>
<p>
No matter how it looked the only image Shira had for this Nalaq spirit was that kind of lowlife.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m not, okay. I didn’t even come near her. My hands are clean and innocent, see?” Good-Natured Spirit said, then sneered his mouth, “what? You’re real jealous, just admit it.”
</p>
<p>
“I told you, it’s not like that. I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case of the young lady of Malikh Family sexually assaulted.”
</p>
<p>
“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”
</p>
<p>
Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh frowned when she heard the voice. But quickly she hid her expression and turned around, greeting, “Is there’s something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for young lady.”
</p>
<p>
Before receiving the content of the box, Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression warily. If true the dress was a fashion then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such expensive homecoming gift Bhela became alerted.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like before, it was a genuine smile that reflected his current emotion, a slick one, the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”
</p>
<p>
Ah, so this was what Elder Jhamil aimed for, Bhela realized. Her face was solemn.
</p>
<p>
“The Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my dearest friend,” she said, with an effort to clarify something.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh said a short and ambigious reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, under the bright moonlight, she took out the dress from the box. Her face contorted.
</p>
<p>
“This kind of things…” 
</p>
<p>
Her lips trembled.
</p>
<p>
A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the chest bone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Badril Village never had brothel. Not since the rage from more than fifty years ago. It was said that kind of dirty practice was put on an end by the powerful matriarch of Malikh Family at the time. Everyone knew Malikh Family hated degradation practice of females like prostitution more than anyone. But never Bhela expected that an elder from her own Malikh Family encouraged her to wear a dress that showed even down to the breast cleavage--not even prostitutes had the daring to wear that kind of dress in public event like ngajen ceremony.
</p>
<p>
Something like making her parents feeling ashamed, she couldn’t do it. Bhela Malikh would never wear this dress. She put it back into the box and walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.
</p>
<p>
The place was used as the family’s <strong>Alchemist</strong>s workplace and some vacant room used to care sick and injured people. When Bhela almost reached the room where her parents were, the pungent of herbs struck her nostrils. This place was unbearable for children and ordinary family members because of the nauseating smells. But for Bhela Malikh it was easy enough to bear as long as she could she her dear parents.
</p>
<p>
“Father, mother, I’m back…” Bhela said after she knocked the door. “Did they send some food here?”
</p>
<p>
“They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.
</p>
<p>
“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and said my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“You girl, sit down. You just return today now you want to run around doing errands? Sit down, here, here.”
</p>
<p>
“No, mother, it’s your chair. I’ll go to another room to get one myself.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela stepped back from the room. With small, noiseless steps she tried not to wake up her father. But the father woke up nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
“Le… letter…”
</p>
<p>
The quivering voice escaped as soon as he weakly opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>
The mother wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life.
</p>
<p>
But mother surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.
</p>
<p>
“I understand your situation. I will send someone but it will takes time. Ask Yulong for help in the meantime.”
</p>
<p>
That was it. The letter unusually shirt and straightforward. No more than three sentences as a reply for someone in his own death door.
</p>
<p>
Bhela who just came back with a chair heard her mother read the entire letter. “Whose letter is that?”
</p>
<p>
“The sender is your great-grandmother who lived oversea,” mother said. 
</p>
<p>
“I see.” Bhela knew her great-grandmother by tales and her father’s stories--a strict matriarch who leaving tales of punishment for her grandson to pass on to his daughter. “Great-grandmother said something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?” 
</p>
<p>
Mother nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Do you believe it, girl? When he was dying from poison, the only one he’d rely on was a stranger from other house.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela froze a beat. “Father was poisoned?”
</p>
<p>
“There’s nothing to hide after you’ve coming back home. Someone slipped in poison to your father’s soup during the ngajen ceremony six months ago. Usual medicine was useless. All those elders who supposed to be on our side were useless. How many times I told them it’s poison they’d think I was craving for attention. Useless.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela poured a water and give it to her mother to calm her down. Mother continued, “Remember this well, girl. Some people stabbed our back when we were falling down and the one who helped us was Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler. Without the poison remedies he gave us your father would be leaving us now.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh frowned. She thought hard about something after what was her mother said.
</p>
<p>
“Bhela…” her father whispered weakly.
</p>
<p>
“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Bhela… don’t…”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, father?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t… do… anything… stupid….”
</p>
<p>
Bhela and the mother looked at the sickly face, who, closing his eyes, fell back to sleep. Her mother glanced at Bhela. Bhela was somehow getting nervous. Not knowing what it meant, the mother sighed and grabbed a bamboo fan and fanning around to prevent mosquitoos from bitting her sleeping husband.
</p>

</p>
<p>
In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted familes, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--this might be appalled for outsiders but if one learned the history of the great waves eastern Kaya refugees incident, families and clans who greatly benefited from the visitors mostly those that could ensnare the foreign talents from eastern Kaya people with their great foods and other local cuisines.
</p>
<p>
“And thus, Shira my boy,” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache. “We southern people naturally different than those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of foods. This is important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”
</p>
<p>
Shira Yashura nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lesson before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.
</p>
<p>
“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instances. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, right? But why is that the one ended up being the patriarch was me?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Shuro, do tell me.” 
</p>
<p>
Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew.
</p>
<p>
“Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who has no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack.”
</p>
<p>
But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Don’t agree too easily with him, stupid. You’ll never know how much bullshit father made up just now.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter popped her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just coming back doing errand.
</p>
<p>
“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. Looking at no one else was there, Mila could guess the two of them been shredding since dawn. “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredding coconut.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind the every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura yelled at his daughter. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That chicken paste satay you like so much is made with shredded coconuts as a base! And don’t forget goat stew with coconuts milk! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! You name it. Coconuts have been blessing us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of daughter you are.” After he calmed down, Patriarch Shuro snorted, then he glanced at Shira. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”
</p>
<p>
That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task shredding coconuts, pretended not to hear the question coming at him.
</p>
<p>
“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”
</p>
<p>
“I see so many made up bullshits I don’t even know where to begin,” Mila Yashura gawked. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”
</p>
<p>
Despite him being an introvert, Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family entangled in planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and children--were talking about it. However he couldn’t raise his head and answer. If he did that, his uncle Shuro would knew he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feeling that way. Thus, while Mila being overly loud today, all Shira need to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fibers of shredded coconuts.
</p>
<p>
“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline between being a tomboy girl and being a fussy aunty.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you holding him back the more people talking shit about him, father!”
</p>
<p>
“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “did I holding you back, Shira my boy?”
</p>
<p>
Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.
</p>
<p>
“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.
</p>
<p>
Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble. 
</p>
<p>
The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”
</p>
<p>
Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.
</p>
<p>
“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.
</p>
<p>
“Too deep my ass,” Mila smirked. Unlike her father, she knew too well when Shira was playing dumb.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go train your swordsmanship. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”
</p>
<p>
Shira glanced at her uncle the patriarch unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela at Malikh Family?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but everyone in Yashura Family think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said to his nephew. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”
</p>
<p>
At the moment, the door of the kitchen knocked. A tall gray-haired old man, with his posture straight and sharp, balancing a tray with a dozen of elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an ettique stranger to most of the villagers.
</p>
<p>
“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixir your father sent for you have arrived,” he said. This old man was Yulong, a western-style butler with classy, neat butler uniform. A rare sight to see in southern land’s big city, less even in a village like this.
</p>
<p>
Like usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those elixirs. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs was some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, so he could only afford to send them in every one or two months. The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single drink after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.
</p>
<p>
“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”
</p>
<p>
Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”
</p>
<p>
“Haha. If those don’t work on your level status quo, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir he drank three years ago was special. He knew it when the poured down into his stomach. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, he remembered it like it happened yesterday. Back then, with only one bottle of elixir, he leveled up from Level 1 to Level 3 overnight--he didn’t even do anything special that day.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh… your experience didn’t even react a single point,” Mila groaned as she summoned a ethereal see-through floating board in front of her.
</p>
<p>
“You did a <strong>Status Window</strong> on him?” 
</p>
<p>
Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though.
</p>
<p>
Shira, feeling another troublesome nagging coming his way. “Ukhhh,” he moaned, rubbing his stomach.
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong boy?” Shuro asked.
</p>
<p>
“My stomach… uncle, I’m afraid if I stay here any longer, I will… corrupt the coconuts…”
</p>
<p>
“What?!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura stood up and his eyes bulged as if he couldn’t believe what he just heard now. “Then, what the hell are you doing here! Get out before it’s too late!”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, uncle. I’ll be--”
</p>
<p>
Shira’s words was cut by a snort. He glanced with the corner of his eyes. His cousin, Mila, crossed her arms and her face became even nastier.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be outside for a while, uncle,” Shira continued with a wry smile. “Please pardon the timing.”
</p>
<p>
After he walked out of the room, Yulong the butler bowed to the patriarch and the sour-faced young lady, then excused himself and followed his Young Master Shira outside.
</p>
<p>
The pair father and daughter exchanged glances. She stared at him.
</p>
<p>
“What?” Shuro Yashura gawked.
</p>
<p>
“You realized he’s escaping to library or spending time painting in the hill, right?”
</p>
<p>
Shuro Yashura sighed. “What do you want me to do? He’s a good kid. He did a good job shredding coconut.”
</p>
<p>
“Look at this, old man,” Mila said as she gently waved the floating status window toward her father, “see what’s wrong with the number?”
</p>
<p>
“Hah, his <strong>Dodge Rating</strong> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with a nod.
</p>
<p>
“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Agility</strong>, <strong>Dexterity</strong>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <strong>Wisdom</strong> attribute now!”
</p>
<p>
“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s a wise kid, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconuts is a serious matter too!”
</p>
<p>
Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicated the conversation.
</p>
<p>
“Father… did you really hear the nickname they gave you?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”
</p>
<p>
“Who said that?”
</p>
<p>
“People.”
</p>
<p>
“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless” so he reckoned young’uns the ones that came up with that.
</p>
<p>
“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”
</p>
<p>
“Oi, mind your words!”
</p>
<p>
“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem supposed to be.”
</p>
<p>
“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”
</p>
<p>
“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless Yashura Family Patriarch like you! You’re a support class, father, a <strong>Specialist</strong> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class appeared to scare them annoying people.”
</p>
<p>
“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”
</p>
<p>
Mila pursed her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”
</p>
<p>
“Her hair?”
</p>
<p>
“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro shook his head. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away these past two years. She lived with people in different cultures and customs. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like normal girls her age. You’re thinking too much.”
</p>
<p>
“Why is everyone thinks Bhela Malikh just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”
</p>
<p>
She smirked.
</p>
<p>
“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”
</p>
<p>
“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”
</p>
<p>
“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”
</p>
<p>
Mila Yashura genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela Malikh serious about cutting her hair?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, yeah! Of course I am.”
</p>
<p>
“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. It’s lifespan wasn’t expired yet, so it still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”
</p>
<p>
Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”
</p>
<p>
“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.
</p>
<p>
Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.
</p>
<p>
Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s <strong>Water</strong> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”
</p>
<p>
When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <strong>Fire</strong>, <strong>Wind</strong>, <strong>Lightning</strong>, and <strong>Water</strong>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.
</p>
<p>
“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.
</p>
<p>
“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t. But I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meats also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with the death alone in that forest. He lived. Then he decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”
</p>
<p>
Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Moss Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.
</p>
<p>
Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You knew what happened after that, right?”
</p>
<p>
She nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle awakened his rare <strong>Poison</strong> elemental affinity.”
</p>
<p>
And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.
</p>
<p>
There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, more exactly, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chances were, an Unique class would be waiting for him.
</p>
<p>
“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It was when he was walking in the corridor, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit. The Nalaq popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!” Shira ignored him because Yulong the butler walking behind him.
</p>
<p>
Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”
</p>
<p>
Shira was acquainted with one of the peddler sponsored by Yashura Family, whenever he paid a visit he’d take out some money to invest. This was one of his independent plan to secure his future as the family heir. He saw the butler was on his stand-by stance as if he prepared a sentence or two for his young master.
</p>
<p>
“Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t give my errands this morning,” the boy said.
</p>
<p>
“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”
</p>
<p>
“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, Mila’s father and mother the ones who took responsibility after him to give him errands.
</p>
<p>
“Young master,” Yulong said, “I’m glad for young master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m all ears.”
</p>
<p>
“You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, young master. Especially those who came approaching you themselves. I hope young master understand this, and to not making friends with nasty people.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.
</p>
<p>
Shira nodded at Yulong’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler, Yulong. Even though he’s began peddling for two years now I found he got a pretty good sense. Someone like him would be extremely stupid to do nasty things when he knows Yashura Family behind him.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so? Hearing your words relieve me greatly. Thank you.”
</p>
<p>
Shira gave a small nod again. Afterward, Yulong excusing himself as he needed to check the servants’ works before arranged for ngajen ceremony pre-planning. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who floating in the way. This might be Shira guessing, but of all people who lived with him, it seemed Yulong hid away the fact he knew about Good-Natured Spirit’s presence, even though the Nalaq himself invisible to most.
</p>
<p>
“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit sneered. He flashed his middle finger to Yulong who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.
</p>
<p>
“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira asked with a frown.
</p>
<p>
“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.
</p>
<p>
“No, the insult.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit grinned.
</p>
<p>
“You know nothing about middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”
</p>
<p>
“Yulong is a good man. He takes care of me a lot. Do me a favor and leave him alone, will you?”
</p>
<p>
Shira felt no motivation to humor Good-Natured Spirit today. “I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go.”
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony, the servants and children were to busy with their own errands. Usually, with a few of copper kobe coins as bribes, the older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to them. Shira was amongst of the lazier older kids who were popular with how generous their bribes were. Even that, in days like this, he couldn’t find someone to bribe. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today.
</p>
<p>
“Is it me or someone’s been staring me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied Shira’s rhetoric question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”
</p>
<p>
“How many following me?” Shira asked. The pedestarians all over him was oblivious of the uninvited stalker watching over the street.
</p>
<p>
“Just one,” Good-Natured Spirit said. “She’s a newbie apparently.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing a newbie was watching over him, Shira turned around and glanced left and right. He searched for a silhouette that had been stalking him but didn’t find a single clue of her presence.
</p>
<p>
“Even though a newbie she still from that Big-Boobed Sect. You’re dreaming to catch them red-handed with your current trashy skill,” Good-Natured Spirit said with a chuckle. Then he glanced at a certain direction, said, “want me to scare her a bit?”
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Hehe.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing that Good-Natured Spirit already decided by himself to harrass the stalker, Shira could do nothing about it. The vulgar Nalaq grinned excitedly, then floating away to greet the miss stalker. The boy kept walking the street without even turning his head, pretended he wasn’t an acquintance of a certain Nalaq.
</p>
<p>
A while later, Shira could hear a shriek of a young woman not far from him.
</p>
<p>
“Poor girl,” Shira muttered with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit came back with a satisfied smile. “As expected, a newb with big beewbs. What a bliss, ah! She’s screaming with only a slight touch. It’s different when it comes to a pro. The woman who previously stalking on you didn’t make a sound when I fondled her big--”
</p>
<p>
“Is it really okay to do that to people from a sect?” Shira cut off with a sour face. He didn’t want to hear this vulgar thing described his crime.
</p>
<p>
“Relax. I know Big-Boobed Sect. They won’t move for a petty little thing.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re ‘petty’ yourself, but I don’t think what you did was a ‘little’ just now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oi, come on! They’ve got big boobs and big butt--it’s a crime to not feeling them a little bit.”
</p>
<p>
“If they someday come to burn you, Ol’ Spirit, please don’t get me involved.”
</p>
<p>
Shira didn’t know what kind of sect that had been watching Badril Village from the dark. If he didn’t meet Good-Natured Spirit one year ago he wouldn’t even know those watchers even existed. Their presence was something that everyday ignorant villagers wouldn’t even dream ever existed here. Their goal to watch a rural place like this too, Shira couldn’t fathom something like that. One thing he knew, however, that their name definitely not ‘Big-Boobed Sect’ like Good-Natured Spirit always call them.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
The boy and the Nalaq continued walking toward the market. Shira didn’t talk much. In case of there was some expert from the watchers who could see Nalaqs, he tried his best looking as if he was not involved with a sexual-harrassing Nalaq behind him.
</p>
<p>
As he feared then, the market was already crowded. 
</p>
<p>
“Yo, I’ll check on those crowd playing cards. Wanna come?” Good-Natured Spirit asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’ve got things to do,” Shira said with tiny voice, almost whispering.
</p>
<p>
“Guess we’re gonna be separate for a while then.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s for the best.”
</p>
<p>
Shira immediately turned around and walked away. Good-Natured Spirit shrugged and he floated to see some people gambling.
</p>
<p>
The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowds as he laid his wares behind his wagon. Tomorrow night was going to be a special ngajen ceremony, it was true for Malikh Family who just got their famous young lady returned back. Because of that times like this the goods and money moved around at faster pace than usual. Shira sighed as he looked the rolled paper he had. It seemed he had to wait till late in the afternoon when the market slowed down or he’d never sell the rejected painting in his hand.
</p>
<p>
The plan was to meet one new peddler Yashura Family just supported. The peddler’s face was a funny one. He looked like a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, his eyes brightened. Immediately he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms greedily. “Can I help you young master?”
</p>
<p>
Shira stepped back when Monkey getting too close. “Monkey, you better do something about your creepy face.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely you jest, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”
</p>
<p>
What was just now? Monkey’s grin suggested knowingly about the rolled paper in Shira’s hands. This might be irritating but apparently Shira had no right to judge the other party of being creepy when he himself secretly came into a crowded place with an erotic painting in his hands. Shira felt something was unusual for Monkey closed the shop just for him. Not that he complaining, by the way, it was convenient for him this way.
</p>
<p>
Monkey took a small peek at the content inexcessively. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, master.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s with the master thing?”
</p>
<p>
“How can I call you ‘young master’ when you yourself already an expert at this stage?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it’s already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyhow, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, master.”
</p>
<p>
By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. A fat, greedy merchants looked innocent compared to him.
</p>
<p>
“You have something else want to add?” Shira asked when he realized Monkey’s acted suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“Hehe, in fact, there is,” Monkey said. “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was kicked from his family--and I must tell you this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, by the way, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”
</p>
<p>
Shira cut off with a reluctant face. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”
</p>
<p>
He might be the heir of Yashura Family, but the position of the patriarch was only available for him in the future. Accessing the family’s treasury to invest on an unknown Alchemist for typical young masters, unless approved by a dozens of elders and the patriarch himself, was utterly impossible. With the fat he got from extorting a certain Nalaq on chess game bets maybe there was something he could do but, strictly speaking, the business relationship he had with Monkey was barely considered good since Shira was only needed a man to buy rejected erotic paintings and other useless but valuable stuffs he got from Good-Natured Spirit. Monkey was nobody but an upstart peddler. The wagon he got originally a broken down cart repaired personally, even. Getting a deal with a heir who hadn’t come to power yet was already more than enough for someone like him. 
</p>
<p>
Monkey knew that. The risk of offending this young master, he also knew that. Therefore, he didn’t want to impose on the young master’s mercy too much and quickly explained the intention he had in mind.
</p>
<p>
“This is a <strong>Boost Elixir</strong> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I asure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sale pitch, which made him looked more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he below an age of twenty! Young master can have it just for half of the original price just for today!”
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t conspiracy, right…” Shira knitted his brows, Monkey froze.
</p>
<p>
“Of--of course not, young master… why would you think that?”
</p>
<p>
“No, someone ordered you to make me drink it?”
</p>
<p>
“You jest again, young master… ha ha… haaa….”
</p>
<p>
“You serious?” Shira gave a smile as he snorted. He took the elixir from the flastergabbed Monkey and directed the bottle toward the sunlight as he saw-through the distilled, clear liquid with one of his eyes. “The liquid surprisingly well made though. Is this really an elixir?”
</p>
<p>
“I said before, young master. The one who made this came from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their lastname still can be a pretty big deal. To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level!”
</p>
<p>
Such a confident boast. If this really the peddler Shira knew was talking, he’d doubled the price instead--not cutting it in half. After all, even though the container was cheap, from a single glance everyone could see this elixir looked like a high-quality one. 
</p>
<p>
Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Young Master Shira… that not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories,” Monkey protested with a forced smile.
</p>
<p>
“Monkey I knew was stupid. If not brainwashed then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families me.”
</p>
<p>
Before Monkey get to retort, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumption about him however you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”
</p>
<p>
A pale man appeared from the wagon Monkey had. He had sickly pale skin. Two hanging tired eye bags on his face suggested the lack of vitality this person had, that made Shira somehow regretted a bit offending him.
</p>
<p>
“You’re the Alchemist?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask my real name,” the pale-skinned Alchemist said.
</p>
<p>
Shira looked at the sick Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey. Creatures of forest. Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”
</p>
<p>
“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid man as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”
</p>
<p>
“Heey! Don’t talk about ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested.
</p>
<p>
Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.
</p>
<p>
“What kind of elixir is this?”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.
</p>
<p>
“You aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy, too heavy, even, that my father kicked me from my family. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype. It cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot. Without the backing from my old family, to sell well throughout the kingdom I need some kind of achievement. The simplest way to gain credibility as an Alchemist to make an elixir that could boost the level of a trash talent like you, the boy named Shira Yashura.”
</p>
<p>
“S-Snake!” Monkey yelped, “you’re too… you are too…”
</p>
<p>
Snake was too honest. Even Shira was caught unguard. He knew many people scoffed at him for being a trash talent but never they did it in front of him.
</p>
<p>
“As the heir of your sponsor, I certainly can’t overlook your impudent words,” Shira said slowly as he swirled the crystal clear elixir.
</p>
<p>
“Oh? That so?” Snake put his fingers on his chin.
</p>
<p>
“Look, you want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, I really don’t mind. The thing is, now that I know your shameless scheme… how much the price, by the way?”
</p>
<p>
“Ten kobe gold coins, young master,” Monkey quickly answered.
</p>
<p>
“Your shameless scheme to use my as a guinea pig cost me five gold coins, isn’t that too much?”
</p>
<p>
“No, the original price is twenty gold coins,” Snake said.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t take out a single copper for a prototype even its success rate is over 120%. No, sir Alchemist,” Shira said. “Let me have this for free, I’ll let your rude words bygone and if this turned out to be promising, maybe I’d try to pull some string to back you up.”
</p>
<p>
To Shira Yashura’s words, Monkey flashed a wide grin stupidly, exposing his unkept yellow teeth. Monkey knew Snake made the entire of his family furious at him and as the result, most of connected people he knew didn’t want to get involved with this Alchemist. It was almost when Snake fell to utter destitute the peddler picked him up and set him under his wing. If possible, Monkey wanted him a bit independent before they could make steady money from Snake’s elixir researches.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, man, let’s cooperate together,” Monkey tried to persuade Snake. “You know I can only handle the cost of researching a simple elixir.”
</p>
<p>
Snake seemed to take his time to put his thought together. He looked at Shira, asked, “You are the son of Sir Jhuro Yashura, am I right?”
</p>
<p>
“You know my father?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do whatever you want if I could get your father as a backer,” Snake said.
</p>
<p>
Even Monkey’s mouth hanged agape when he found out the arrogant Alchemist he knew could offer such submissive condition in exchanged of a backing from Shira’s father.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be surprised that much,” Snake said when he saw Monkey’s stupid surprised face. “Yashura Family might not be worth much, but even from where I came, the venomenous Blackfang Swordsman’s name rang clear and true.” He turned his head to Shira Yashura. “How about it, boy? Can you get your father backs me up? Even if you could borrow his name I’ll do something for you.”
</p>
<p>
Shira said, “My father doesn’t come home very often, so I can’t make any promise.”
</p>
<p>
“How about your name as your father’s successor, then?”
</p>
<p>
“My father’s not the partriarch. Even if he inherit something to me, at best it’d be some small lands and a small house.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think that’s true. It seems you don’t know what your father did outside this little village.”
</p>
<p>
“What Sir Jhuro did outside?” Monkey blurted a question.
</p>
<p>
“Many things, some ridiculously amazing, some might be exaggeration,” Snake said. “I don’t know which one’s true so I’ll be restrain to tell you what I’ve been hearing about him till now.”
</p>
<p>
In the end, Shira agreed to promise his own name for the future, but they didn’t really reach a satisfying conclusion about the negotation because either the party weren’t really that passionate to support each other. He got to drink the Boost Elixir for free though. The effect, however, was very disappointing.
</p>
<p>
“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice. “With this, the success rate falls to 50%...”
</p>
<p>
Snake said nothing as he read Shira’s stats from the <strong>Status Window</strong> Monkey made with his magic ring. 
</p>
<p>
“So… it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.
</p>
<p>
Monkey could only nodded weakly. Seeing that he didn’t have anymore business with them, Shira Yashura excused himself and began to walk away.
</p>
<p>
“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”
</p>
<p>
Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.
</p>
<p>
“Try to drink this one,” Snake said. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay.”
</p>
<p>
The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one also free, Shira Yashura didn’t hesitate to drink it. 
</p>
<p>
The after taste was incredibly sour unlike the bitter taste of the usual Boost Elixirs. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.
</p>
<p>
“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”
</p>
<p>
“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,” Snake said. He put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, Snake once again looked at Shira, he said, “if it’s alright with you, Young Master Shira, I still interested about our cooperation in the future. Especially when you get your inheritance from your father. I’ll be around traveling with Monkey so please talk with him regarding the money talks.”
</p>
<p>
After he disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>
“What’s with him being polite all of the sudden?” Shira asked.
</p>
<p>
“Beats me,” Monkey grinned. “He’s always an oddball ever since I knew him, young master.”
</p>
<p>
Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. Good-Natured Spirit told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games, but if the moral-questionable Nalaq cooperated with the boy the certainly could snatch all those money with ease. On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.
