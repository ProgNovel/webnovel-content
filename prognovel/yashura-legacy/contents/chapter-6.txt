<p>
When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”
</p>
<p>
The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.
</p>
<p>
“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”
</p>
<p>
“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.
</p>
<p>
The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”
</p>
<p>
Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.
</p>
<p>
Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.
</p>
<p>
“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”
</p>
<p>
After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.
</p>
<p>
Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.
</p>
<p>
The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.
</p>
<p>
“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”
</p>
<p>
The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.
</p>
<p>
“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”
</p>
<p>
“Why can’t I?!”
</p>
<p>
“You must present yourself as  a proper young lady, so you can’t!”
</p>
<p>
The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”
</p>
<p>
“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”
</p>
<p>
“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.
</p>
<p>
It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.
</p>
<p>
“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”
</p>
<p>
Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”
</p>
<p>
“To Badril Village!”
</p>
<p>
“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”
</p>
<p>
“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”
</p>
<p>
“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”
</p>
<p>
“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”
</p>
<p>
Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.
</p>
<p>
“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.
</p>
<p>
“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”
</p>
<p>
“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”
</p>
<p>
“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”
</p>
<p>
“Forget about it, it’s not important--”
</p>
<p>
“Boobs are important, ey!”
</p>
<p>
Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”
</p>
<p>
“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”
</p>
<p>
“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.
</p>
<p>
After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.
</p>
<p>
“Check mate.”
</p>
<p>
“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”
</p>
<p>
“No, it is not.”
</p>
<p>
“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>
“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”
</p>
<p>
Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”
</p>
<p>
“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”
</p>
<p>
“How many times do I have to tell you--”
</p>
<p>
“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”
</p>
<p>
Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”
</p>
<p>
“Huh… what?”
</p>
<p>
“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”
</p>
<p>
“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”
</p>
<p>
“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”
</p>
<p>
After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.
</p>
<p>
Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful. 
</p>
<p>
After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.
</p>
<p>
“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.
</p>
<p>
When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.
</p>
<p>
He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”
</p>
<p>
He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.
</p>
<p>
“Where is it again?”
</p>
<p>
He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there it--”
</p>
<p>
<em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.
</p>
<p>
Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.
</p>
<p>
As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”
</p>
<p>
Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.
</p>
<p>
“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his. 
</p>
<p>
“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”
</p>
<p>
“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”
</p>
<p>
“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.
</p>
<p>
Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”
</p>
<p>
Shira nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.
</p>
<p>
The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.
</p>
<p>
“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”
</p>
<p>
The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.
</p>
<p>
Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.
</p>
<p>
“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.
</p>
<p>
Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”
</p>
<p>
After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.
</p>
<p>
“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”
</p>
<p>
“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.
</p>
<p>
Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.
</p>
<p>
“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.
</p>
<p>
“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”
</p>
<p>
“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.
</p>
<p>
“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”
</p>
<p>
Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.
</p>
<p>
“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.
</p>
<p>
The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”
</p>
<p>
“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit. 
</p>
<p>
“As expected of such expert!” 
</p>
<p>
“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”
</p>
<p>
“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”
</p>
<p>
They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.
</p>
<p>
When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.
</p>
<p>
“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”
</p>
<p>
Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”
</p>
<p>
“Are they really okay, though?”
</p>
<p>
Yulong smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”
</p>
<p>
Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.
</p>
<p>
“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.
</p>
<p>
“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”
</p>
<p>
“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”
</p>
<p>
“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”
</p>
<p>
Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.
</p>
<p>
“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”
</p>
<p>
Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.
</p>
<p>
Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.
</p>
<p>
Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.
</p>
<p>
“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”
</p>
<p>
Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks. 
</p>
<p>
The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.
</p>
<p>
“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.
</p>
<p>
It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.
</p>
<p>
There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.
</p>
<p>
However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.
</p>
<p>
“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~
</p>
<p>
Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~
</p>
<p>
Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~
</p>
<p>
Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~
</p>
<p>
The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”
</p>
<p>
There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.
</p>
<p>
“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”
</p>
<p>
“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”
</p>
<p>
“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.
</p>
<p>
“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.
</p>
<p>
“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.
</p>
<p>
“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.
</p>
<p>
Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”
</p>
<p>
Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.
</p>
<p>
Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.
</p>
<p>
“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.
</p>
<p>
The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”
</p>
<p>
The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”
</p>
<p>
The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.
</p>
<p>
Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.
</p>
<p>
“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”
</p>
<p>
Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”
</p>
<p>
Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.
</p>
<p>
“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.
</p>
<p>
“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <strong>Haste</strong>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela got a young coconut in her other hand. She completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.
</p>
<p>
“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“For me? Really?”
</p>
<p>
“Drink slowly…”
</p>
<p>
<em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!
</p>
<p>
“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.
</p>
<p>
“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!
</p>
<p>
“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.
</p>
<p>
“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s your medicine now?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh. I throw it away last night.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.
</p>
<p>
Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”
</p>
<p>
The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.
</p>
<p>
“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”
</p>
<p>
“Star fruits! Woohooo!”
</p>
<p>
The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.
</p>
<p>
“Young lady is… finally… finally…”
</p>
<p>
“She finally has a friend…”
</p>
<p>
“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”
</p>
<p>
Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.
</p>
<p>
However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.
</p>
<p>
Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.
</p>
<p>
“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to  pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.
</p>
<p>
After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.
</p>
<p>
“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.
</p>
<p>
The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased. 
</p>
<p>
And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games. 
</p>
<p>
In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.
</p>
<p>
“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.
</p>
<p>
The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”
</p>
<p>
“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”
</p>
<p>
Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.
</p>
<p>
“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”
</p>
<p>
“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”
</p>
<p>
Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.
</p>
<p>
“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”
</p>
<p>
“And that is?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”
</p>
<p>
Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.
</p>
<p>
“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”
</p>
<p>
The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”
</p>
<p>
“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!
</p>
<p>
“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”
</p>
<p>
“Hmm, what do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them. 
</p>
<p>
When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was. 
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.
</p>
<p>
Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.
</p>
<p>
“Y-young Lady Lyla…”
</p>
<p>
Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.
</p>
<p>
However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.
</p>
<p>
It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.
</p>
<p>
“It’s… sweet.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.
</p>
<p>
“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”
</p>
<p>
Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”
</p>
<p>
“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”
</p>
<p>
“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”
</p>
<p>
The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly. 
</p>
<p>
In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….
</p>
<p>
The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.
</p>
<p>
“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”
</p>
<p>
Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.
</p>
<p>
“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”
</p>
<p>
“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior. 
</p>
<p>
Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family. 
</p>
<p>
Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.

“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”

“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”
</p>
<p>
“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”
</p>
<p>
“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”
</p>
<p>
Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.
</p>
<p>
“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”
</p>
<p>
She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.
</p>
<p>
“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”
</p>
<p>
“What did they do?” Bhela asked.
</p>
<p>
“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”
</p>
<p>
Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.
</p>
<p>
“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Different? How so?”
</p>
<p>
Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.
</p>
<p>
“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”
</p>
<p>
“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.
</p>
<p>
Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”
</p>
<p>
“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride. 
</p>
<p>
Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”
</p>
<p>
The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”
</p>
<p>
“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.
</p>
<p>
“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one. 
</p>
<p>
It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!
</p>
<p>
The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”
</p>
<p>
“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”
</p>
<p>
It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”
</p>
<p>
“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.
</p>
<p>
“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”
</p>
<p>
“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought a satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.
</p>
<p>
“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”
</p>
<p>
Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.
</p>
<p>
Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion regarding that person--even if the cause of her dislike was a trivial misunderstanding. However, Bhela didn’t have any reason to defend Elder Jhamil’s niece. Not to mention, the fact that she was a relative of her political enemy which was subtly approaching Lyla with ulterior motives. It was better for Lyla to not meeting with these girls again.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.
</p>
<p>
“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Bhela must leads her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”
</p>
<p>
“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”
</p>
<p>
Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip.
