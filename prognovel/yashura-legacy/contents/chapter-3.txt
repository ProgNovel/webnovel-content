<p>
What Good-Natured Spirit told Shira lingered in his mind. That jerk Nalaq blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that. The more he thought about it, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.
</p>
<p>
“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him. The man’s body even redder, drenched in thicker blood than him. The sight didn’t make the boy flinched, however.
</p>
<p>
The hunter spun a small yet sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, offering the dagger to Shira. “Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said. 
</p>
<p>
He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging.
</p>
<p>
Currently his body reeked of blood. He glad he wore worn out clothes. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats. It was part of the custom on the day of ngajen ceremony. As the custom dictated, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys dealt with cows and goats while the girls would help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers--they had to do it whether they were lowly guards’ children or the family’s next heir. When he became twenty the goats he had to butcher would increased year by year. But for now, for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.
</p>
<p>
After done doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. Then he strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. In there, he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods. Patriarch Shuro Yashura, who would be the Chief Chef for Yashura Family’s tonight ceremony, did his magical cooking skills well. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of cooked beef the locals called <em>rendang</em>--which, of course, cooked in drenching coconut milk seven hours straight till the texture became muddy and the meats became deliciously tender. Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows--not including the innards which were quite popular cuisines if one asked the locals’ tongues--like <em>rendang</em> and grilled beef only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony. Normally a young master like Shira would get to eat <em>rendang</em> once every few months. But he got his own tricks and he’d take his delicious reward as much as he could get.
</p>
<p>
“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our <em>rendangs </em>for their main family.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, sure,” crouching in the shadow of a thick pillar, Shira nodded like a parrot. His hands couldn’t stop shoving white rice and <em>rendang</em> happily.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon that day, he made time to play a chess game with Good-Natured Spirit. Good-Natured Spirit didn’t mentioned any talking about killing people again, so Shira concluded that the Nalaq was only messing with him.
</p>
<p>
“This has been on my mind recently,” Good-Natured Spirit chimed as he took out a pouch of coins as he lost the chess game bet. “But why do you like money so much? I can give you some cool skill or battle technique, y’know. You’d be a chick magnet even if your level shitty if you did some of my battle techniques.”
</p>
<p>
“My future,” Shira said as he weighed the pouch. “I’m not a skilled fighter like my father nor I’m a great cook like my uncle--become a patriarch in the future without something to hold on is pretty tough.”
</p>
<p>
“You know with only having a great wealth doesn’t mean that you’d become powerful, right?”
</p>
<p>
“At least I can make my family live comfortably with that.”
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Later, when the boy arrived at the market he found Monkey was packing up his wares. The ngajen ceremony would be held tonight. So villagers didn’t like merchants from outside the village loitering around with their selling goods. Snake was smoking a tobacco pipe by the carriage, bathing under the sun to combat the suffocating sour-smelling humidity that came from his experiments. They told Shira their plan to visit one of big families, not as peddlers, but as guests, so they could eat good foods in the last day they were here. Hearing that Shira invited them to visit Yashura Family tonight. Monkey readily agreed with a big grin.
</p>
<p>
“You decided to invest on the potion you drank yesterday?” Snake raised his brows when Shira finally said his intention. “Which one?”
</p>
<p>
“Both of them,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
“The last one is not something I can create right now. But if you get me your father’s backing then maybe there’s something I can do--in ten years time, minimum.”
</p>
<p>
Shira shook his head. “Too long.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s short, believe me--for that sort of elixir.”
</p>
<p>
Shira then remembered how the container of that elixir was luxurious, even though the content was only so-so. It was no ordinary elixir.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go with your prototype masterpiece then. It’s a 100% success rate elixir, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” Monkey confessed, “it’s down to 50% since the elixir not working on you yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
“That is too fast to boast about 100% rate, isn’t it? Who’s the other 50%?”
</p>
<p>
Monkey sheepishly replied, “Me…”
</p>
<p>
Snake crossed his arms, gesturing he wanted to start talking real business. “Let’s see how serious you are, then.”
</p>
<p>
Shira’d prepared his wealth beforehand. He didn’t have much local kobe coins but since the other party was a foreigner, he thought maybe he could do something with the money Good-Natured Spirit gave him. His bag was fat, but not fat enough to scare people. When he opened it, however, the faces of the peddler and the alchemist were frozen in an instant.
</p>
<p>
“These coins…” Monkey couldn’t believe what he picked with his fingers.
</p>
<p>
Shira said, “Not enough? I have lots of kobe coins too, just in case.”
</p>
<p>
Snake snatched one of the coins from Monkey’s hand. He inspected the coin himself, the foreign one Shira won from Good-Natured Spirit not too long ago.
</p>
<p>
“That’s not the case. You managed to surprise us, Young Master Shira Yashura,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The Alchemist’s usual sharp tone became mellower all of the sudden.
</p>
<p>
“W-where did you get all these coins, young master?” Monkey said.
</p>
<p>
But Snake flicked the coin back to Monkey and said to Shira, “You don’t have to speak, young master. It’s Tatalghia Kingdom’s coins. Good money. Monkey and I can raise our credibility amongst the merchant circle holding on this currency alone. They’d think we have a transactions with the westerners, maybe we could make them believe we have connections with Tatalghia Kingdom’s merchants.” He stopped, peered the young master before him. “Still, I couldn’t have ever guessed that you manage to conjure Tatalghia Kingdom’s coin by yourself. I reckon Yashura Family isn’t behind this, I'm a bit curious but… I shouldn’t have pry too much, am I?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be grateful if we can have a comfortable level of secret between us, Mister Snake, Mister Monkey,” Shira smiled. He didn’t have the mood to explain the coins were hard-working fruits he got from gambling with an annoying Nalaq.
</p>
<p>
Snake nodded. He didn’t pursue the case any further as he stuffed the Tatalghia coins into Monkey’s carriage. He said, “I’ve got something to do in the capital next month so you have Monkey alone to deal with. I’ll work to improve my prototype elixir in the meantime, so you’ll have to wait for sometime before the money you’ve invested on us rolled back to you. Do you have any objection with this arrangement, young master?”
</p>
<p>
“No, you do what you have to do. Even if I kept those foreign coins with me there’s nothing to do with them since they are rare around here.”
</p>
<p>
As a gift, Snake gave him a bottle of herbal balm to treat internal injuries. Before they got separated, Shira shoved a few pieces of kobe gold coins more to Monkey, saying he’d like to invest in low-risk commodities like the popular white peppers and told Monkey to give him back some of them next month. Most boys around his age never bought gold coins with them but surely Shira was different. And that was enough to command the eager Monkey who swiftly ran around from shop to shop and bought some spices he could sell in the next village with Shira’s money. That concluded the business, which turned out to be smoother than Shira though.
</p>
<p>
Walking home satisfied that he accomplished something worthwhile, he suddenly remembered he had to go to Malikh Family for tonight’s ngajen ceremony. At the thought, he sighed wearily.
</p>
<p>
He didn’t say much to his cousin and uncle, but since the engagement arrangement revealed, the relationship between him and Bhela Malikh had gone beyond the point of awkwardness. Visiting the Malikh Family was a plainly troublesome matter. If there was a chance for him to bail out, he’d take it anytime.
</p>
<p>
Back in the market. It was when Shira no longer around. Monkey approached Snake with a hesitated face.
</p>
<p>
“This is quite troubling my mind since yesterday,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“What is?”
</p>
<p>
“You said the later elixir Young Master Shira drank isn’t for human consumption, isn’t that right?”
</p>
<p>
“I recall I said that, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“T-then…” Monkey lowered his voice. “What is Young Master Shira?”
</p>
<p>
“Monkey….”
</p>
<p>
“Y-yes?”
</p>
<p>
Snake’s voice was cold.
</p>
<p>
“It’s better for you to stay ignorant.”
</p>
<p>
Monkey unwillingly nodded. The warning rolled out from Snake’s lips was by no means a joke. He stepped back with his head lowered to the ground. At a time like this, he ought to cultivate his ability to play along with the flow and pretended to know nothing. He’d live longer that way.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Laughters and chatters made the night more crowdful. It was brighter than usual. Villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers. The licking flames lining up and danced, as if their light guided the road that connected from houses to houses. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering spicy smells wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. Most were looking forward to taste their free food tonight. 
</p>
<p>
Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating for Malikh Family’s ceremony; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everybody’s expectations.
</p>
<p>
Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle in his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connection outside the kingdom, so the materials wasn’t from around here and sometimes annoyingly he got itches in places he shouldn’t scratch whenever people were around. But fabric wasn’t stiff, and the style also simple but not common. Some parts of the suit glimmered next to lighting from the braziers and torches in not so flashy manner. All in all, it was a good wear--if not counting the itchy part. 
</p>
<p>
What was missing, though, a pelt boys around his age wore around their necks. 
</p>
<p>
Boys usually wore pelts with smug expressions on their faces. Wearing pelts from the beast they hunted themselves was an unspoken custom to show one’s courage and manliness, fashionable fad for boys who hungry for girls’ attentions. A proven method as one of the easiest ways to get laid. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, as the young master who carried the name of Yashura Family, Shira Yashura never mingled in that kind of indecent businesses. He was one of those dull kids who were never looking forward for ngajen ceremony like brats his age. The only girl who would accompany him in this kind of ceremony was his cousin Mila Yashura, who, despite her face was quite pretty, seemed never to be approached by one of those horny boys with pelts hanging on their shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“No matter how many times I see it, you girls always do wonder with your fingers when it comes to something like this,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped <em>rendang</em> with banana leaves. She was very good at it.
</p>
<p>
“You talking? You’ve done your training with family’s sword technique, I assume?” Mila asked.
</p>
<p>
Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nagging her mouth off immediately she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in troubled look.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t use that,” he protested.
</p>
<p>
“You--” Mila hissed. Apparently, from the family’s vault, she prepared for him an eastern Kaya style slim blade his father Jhuro Yashura used to have in his youth. Mila wanted to use her uncle’s prestige to heightened Shira’s impressions later when they visited Malikh Family. But all coming to waste if they boy himself wouldn’t bother to sharpen his sword skills.
</p>
<p>
“What should I do with a sword in another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I won’t be able to swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s because you’ve been stupidly increased your Wisdom, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”
</p>
<p>
“This is embarrassing,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d getting more reluctant to show his face in the public later on.
</p>
<p>
Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. She could care less about the rumor. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short. While her hands craftly knotted the <em>rendang</em> wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.
</p>
<p>
“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”
</p>
<p>
Shira stepped back. From some reason Mila was becoming even more terrifying than before.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the ngajen ceremony always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. The Malikh Family’s kitchen couldn’t hold them all.
</p>
<p>
After hours and hours of hard work since morning, most of the dishes already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who still on duty preparing foods were a small number of aunties and maidservants, who happened to cook for the last batch. The young maidservants were tired but they still could fight a bit more. And the aunties didn’t show a sign of wanting to rest. When it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods, which lasted from the sun rose till the sun fell, nothing could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies.
</p>
<p>
Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In ngajen ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed. Since she was not in the mood to meet with people, Bhela stepped in to fill her position. When she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, thus she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kind of cuisines without having to waste them--it was quite an important matter since its expense was quite heavy every time ngajen ceremony was held. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.
</p>
<p>
There was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy, though. The largest furnace that usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. But the problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy.
</p>
<p>
“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, young lady no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.
</p>
<p>
“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding from my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.
</p>
<p>
Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenty came leading four manservants with him. It was an unspoken rule for the men not to approach the kitchen unless they were helpers for the one who cooked the main course. They came fetching the foods the old man cooked. But the strangest part was, all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction. While the one who cooked for the main course, who usually the patriarch himself, supposed to be the main conductor of the kitchen and holding authority even above the supervisor like Bhela was, this old cook didn’t act anything like that and instead, he promptly stopped cooking to greet Elder Jhamil’s son with his head lowered.
</p>
<p>
“Why aren’t you ready yet old worm?!” the loud, unpleasant yell belonged to Elder Jhamil’s son. It seemed it wasn’t his first time acting arrogant in the kitchen as he was comfortable being a tyrant without caring the scared, hesitant eyes peering at him. He was so comfortable he wasn’t even realized Bhela Malikh was melding amongst the aunties in deeper side of the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”
</p>
<p>
<em>Slap!!</em>
</p>
<p>
The slapping sound echoed the kitchen. The room descended to dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “the first elder from Village Hall has come; they’re supposed to know that my father’s cooking food faster than anyone else in the village. We must complete the set before too long! People must know my father can cook faster than everyone else!”
</p>
<p>
One by one, the followers twitted agreeingly. “Young elder is right. This old man can’t cook shit! The only achievement Elder Jhamil could have is the fastest cook if this old worm handles the wok!”
</p>
<p>
The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. As far as Bhela remembered the man wasn’t that competent to be qualified to enter the family’s inner council. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how Elder Jhamil could have any achievement while she, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see him even once today. Customs and rules were broken so blatantly. It was clear Elder Jhamil wanted to steal credits while Bhela’s father couldn’t do nothing in his ill-bed.
</p>
<p>
“This is wrong in so many ways,” Bhela whispered. She looked around, saw the aunties and the maidservants, though with the sympathy in their eyes, were afraid to stand for the old man. The situation apparently quite complicated, Bhela found out. So she holding back from opening her mouth. As the young lady from the main family, she quietly assessing the situation she wasn’t expecting to happen.
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil’s son ordered his followers to gather the food. They preyed upon the common dishes made by the aunties and the maidservants cooked. The arrogant young elder, despite knowing the custom, told his men to switch the banana leaves covered clay plates with the ceramic bowls and plates--most of which were imported and quite expensive. That way they could pretend the dishes were theirs.
</p>
<p>
“They wore the family official robes but acted like a bunch of thieves,” someone whispered with a low voice. Even the gentlest ones amongst the aunties crinkled their noses and scowled silently at their impudentness.
</p>
<p>
“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward as she felt swapping common foods for important guests was completely out of the line, “you can’t do that! Having important guests to eat common dishes is rude. You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew about th--eeekkh!!”
</p>
<p>
The tyrannical young elder raised his hand. Fortunately the brave aunty wasn’t so brave that she’d promptly stepped back whilst her hands covered her check. Elder Jhamil’s son didn’t swing his hand though, he proceeded into a barking rampage, yelling and threatening them to cut their salary and the portion of leftover foods they’d get after the ceremony as if his father held the entire Malikh Family’s treasury with iron grasp. His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.
</p>
<p>
After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great confidence. A maidservant who was in the way immediately retreated. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need <em>rendang</em> for the main course. So make it, old man. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties sympathized with him more and more. Only two to three hours before the ceremony started. To start cooking <em>rendang</em> without any preparation beforehand was difficult. With only two hours the <em>rendang</em> wouldn’t be as tender as the southern people liked it. If he couldn’t deliver the <em>rendang</em> everybody loved, what was going to happen then? Bhela didn’t know but she planned to find out later on.
</p>
<p>
After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
Bhela found it was unusual for mere servants would guard against a member of the main family, the sole daughter of the current patriarch nonetheless. However, when she thought about it again, the atmosphere in the family since she returned home two days ago, not counting the solemn air around the topic of her ill father, it was strangely cold and strangely tense.
</p>
<p>
An aunty tugged her sleeve and whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already getting used to it. You’re still young, young lady. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh realized this pudgy aunty who was giving her advice was the one who standing in front of her while the son of Elder Jhamil made a ruckus. Before, she thought it was a coincidence for this aunty immediately stood in front of her when the unpleasant scene started. But after looking at the troubled expression on the aunty’s face, Bhela knew that wasn’t the case.
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family. Her future would be worthless if she couldn’t do anything about the present.
</p>
<p>
The pudgy aunty wanted to say something. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking <em>rendang</em>. However, he only got three hours maximum this time. All of his experience and expertise would go to the drain if Elder Jhamil sent bullies instead of helpers. Even the most ignorant maidservants would be able to tell the old man wouldn’t be able to escape punishment after this.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.
</p>
<p>
“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment. She looked like she came from the outer family but it was clear that she wasn’t. No matter how oblivious the old man was, when facing the famous cold beauty everyone had been talking about, he instantly knew her real identity.
</p>
<p>
“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”
</p>
<p>
The old man hesitantly shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”
</p>
<p>
“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. At least a status of an elder would be needed to be his substitute in case of him can’t cook for the ceremony.”
</p>
<p>
The old man began to tremble. Even worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son harassment before. Some people in the family council might know the trick Elder Jhamil was pulling to insert an outer member like the old man to cook. However, if the matter to be spoken for the entire family to hear, from the one and only Young Lady of Malikh Family nonetheless, the old man knew the result would be as scary as Elder Jhamil’s threat. Because of that he didn’t know what to do. He had forgotten the coconut and the shredder in his hands as he was busy scared over his fate instead. Seeing that the old was frozen, Bhela Malikh proceed to grab the cooking lid and told the aunties and the maidservants in the kitchen about her plan.
</p>
<p>
“I brought some spices from faraway land with me and some dried curry leaves. I want to make chicken curry for tonight’s main course instead. Please tell someone to butcher some chicken immediately, and you--” Bhela pointed at the youngest maidservant in kitchen, the same age as she was, “--please go to my room and pick the yellow box on the drawer. It’s beside the bed. Sniff for spices’ aroma to be sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”
</p>
<p>
“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.
</p>
<p>
An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of patriarch’s absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”
</p>
<p>
The old man’s face turned pale. There was no point to ask him that kind of question. Everyone in the kitchen already knew the answer. There was no one with a real authority there to stop Bhela Malikh from doing what she wanted to do.
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, from the mouths of the aunty and the maidservant who fetched the chickens and the spices for her, not long after that, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never happened in Badril Village’s history a daughter would do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenge the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admirement. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.
</p>
<p>
“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?” the elder continued with a balked expression.
</p>
<p>
“I’m working,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No women can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s there, you’re just too young to know it!”
</p>
<p>
Bhela wasn’t afraid to show her frown. She said, “No point of talking about rules when they clearly broken for profit for a certain individual and his group. That’s just underhanded. Besides, two generations before my father our Malikh Family was led by a matriarch. She raised our family as one of three major families of Badril Village. I’m sure by the Mossack tradition standard, especially in this village, no decent leaders can hold their positions if they don’t take the main stage during ngajen ceremony. That matriarch had to be at least the best cook in the village to be able to expand our Malikh Family at the time.”
</p>
<p>
She was sure the so called rules of women not being able to substitute for the patriarch, only something Elder Jhamil conjured out of thin air as he freaked out his scheming of using an old cook being found by her.
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil was tongue-tied. He didn’t expect the young lady, who usually behaved herself, would fight him over this matter. He knew he was clearly in the wrong here. He knew he had a weakness since most likely, from how she dressed herself commonly as if she had been working in the kitchen all day, Bhela Malikh witnessed how the old cook he planted being forced to cook for the ngajen ceremony’s main course. If his opponent was an ordinary elder then Elder Jhamil knew a handful of tricks to make them submit. But now he was facing the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh--on top of just returned from abroad and had a ridiculous amount of fame and admirers, she recently showed a brilliant talent that it’d hard to measure her future potential. Blatantly crushing her would be no good for Elder Jhamil. A socially-suicide move, even. No matter how arrogant he was, Elder Jhamil knew this time that he had to step back from being to pumpous in his dealing.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, a certain tyrannical young elder, the son who happened not as sophisticated as his father, yelled, “Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?”
</p>
<p>
The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead. No one dared to, though. They kept their mouth shut to avoid troubles.
</p>
<p>
Thus Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Ethically speaking, if the food she’d make was for the guests to eat, then there was no need for her pay the ingredients for herself. 
</p>
<p>
In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about cheap spices. I’m talking about the chicken you asked to be butchered! They cost money, young lady! What do you say about that, huh?”
</p>
<p>
Bhela blinked. She was dumbfounded. Not because she was dumbfounded by the young elder’s intimidation but because of his sheer stupidity. 
</p>
<p>
In front of the crowd, no sane person with a title of an elder would recklessly raise his voice against a member of main family, the sole young lady at that. Apparently, the young elder couldn’t hold back his anger when he realized Bhela was there to see how he cheating the old cook, playing dumb and waiting for a moment to make him lost his face--at least what he thought.
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh didn’t glare. Not even annoyed. But her eyes were sharply stabbed at the sneaky bald elder, the father, who immediately taking a few subtle steps back, acting like he had nothing to do with this. It seemed to Bhela that even toward his son Elder Jhamil was a calculating man. It was really obvious. By letting his son barking at her, he thought he could make the young lady behave a little. Then he’d wash his hands clean by berating his son with good words, or maybe, taking back his new elder’s position just to be sure. His own son merely a pawn for him. 
</p>
<p>
While his son yelling loudly, Elder Jhamil gloated. He thought giving a scare to a fifteen years young lady was a good idea. He’d grasp the situation faster that way. Unfortunately for Elder Jhamil, Bhela Malikh wasn’t anything like girl he thought she was.
</p>
<p>
“I will pay for the chicken,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”
</p>
<p>
“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Although the expressionless on Bhela’s face still didn’t change, her voice creepingly cold, her eyes dangerously even colder. Mentioning her unfortunate father was the bottom line. “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket,” she said. “He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear it in parties. So if I sell the dress it should cover the cost for some chickens.” 
</p>
<p>
Bhela tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.
</p>
<p>
“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued merely as some village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady?” Elder Jhamil’s son scoffed so loudly he even startled his father who stood near him. “The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! It’s as clear as day you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”
</p>
<p>
<em>Paak!</em>
</p>
<p>
From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”
</p>
<p>
While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook. 
</p>
<p>
That didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiled water in splashed it in the direction of the annoying pair father and son. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.
</p>
<p>
“Please get out,” Bhela said coldly.
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”
</p>
<p>
<em>Splash!</em>
</p>
<p>
Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.
</p>
<p>
“Young lady…”
</p>
<p>
As the sole daughter of the Malikh Family patriarch, Bhela Malikh felt she needed to exercise her right to make one or two political statements. She said, “Elder Jhamil, although there is no rule that states I can’t use the family’s treasury funds to cook for ngajen ceremony, this time, I’ll use money from my own pocket to cover the costs of my own cooking per your son’s request. In return, I want a small favor, Elder Jhamil. I recall there’s at least three elders who are more senior and more capable than you to substitute my father. But since you <em>generously</em> attend the position to cook for important guests, it seems the elders I mentioned can’t take the Chief Chef position, no? In that case, while it’s a bit unconventional, I’d like to substitute for my father who unfortunately can’t be here for us. I’d like to cook with my own recipe instead the position of Chief Chef taken by an elder who’s too busy to <em>personally </em>come to the kitchen. Can you relay the message to other elders in charge?”
</p>
<p>
The room immediately came to an uncomfortable silence right after Bhela Malikh finished her words. Even the dumbest maidservant knew the subtle rebellation behind what had been said. Thus the women showed trouble expressions as they looked at the determined young lady’s face. The arrogant young elder wanted to argue, but his father Elder Jhamil gripped his shoulder to make him shut his mouth up.
</p>
<p>
“Since there’s a kind noble comes hundreds of miles away to come here and meet you, I guess you want to personally cook for him, am I right?” Elder Jhamil said with a smile, sour smile. “If that makes Young Lady Bhela happy, I guess we can bend some rules a little bit.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela calmly bowed her head and said, “Thank you, honorable elder. I’ll be in your debt.” By the time she raised her head, her face immediately went colder, and she continued, “now, please get out from here.”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil snorted and he turned, waving his hands to gather his men. 
</p>
<p>
Aunties and maidservants timidly made way for them as they retreated with naked dissatisfaction on their faces. They were horrified. Bhela still had a bright future for her, they were worried to see her making enemy with an influential elder in the family. 
</p>
<p>
Not long after that, Bhela received the chickens she wanted, along with the spices from her room, and she began to cook chicken curry.
</p>
<p>
“Mmm…” Bhela mumbled as she tasted the thickening broth. Beside her, an obedient little maidservant, the same who fetched the spices from her room, was waiting for the next instruction from the young Chief Chef. “Try this,” Bhela told her.
</p>
<p>
The maidservant received a few drops of the brooth on her back hand, licked it and then her eyes glistened immediately.
</p>
<p>
“Good?”
</p>
<p>
The maidservant raised her head and looked at Bhela. She nodded, and Bhela nodded back at her. After than Bhela continued to stir the bubbling simmered chicken curry.
</p>
<p>
“Did you know,” Bhela said, “that westerners often confused <em>rendang</em> as dried curry?”
</p>
<p>
“You learned that while you were away, young lady?” the maidservant asked.
</p>
<p>
Bhela replied with a nod. She said, “Curry and <em>rendang</em>, they almost the same but they are different. Curry originated in the southest of the south and their turmeric, for example, is completely different than ours who rooted from our southeast Mossacks ancestors. You change one of these spices and the food you cook would end up completely different foods. Although these two cuisines share the same bases such as meat and coconut-milk, they’re still completely two different delicacies one should have eating at least once in their lifetime.” Bhela thought the curry she made ready to serve, so she gestured the maidservant to pick some high-quality ceramic plate to pour it on. “People in the west, though,” she continued on, eyes on the curry, “can’t eat <em>rendang</em> with dry sauce. Two years living oversea I only ate wet <em>rendang</em>, it just different for my tongue. They should’ve make original curry instead.”
</p>
<p>
The little maidservant blinked. The Young Lady of Malikh Family she remembered two years ago was cold and aloof, she didn’t expect her to talk so much about <em>rendang</em> and before too, she talked a lot to trash Elder Jhamil and his son.
</p>
<p>
When they saw the contrast of their young lady’s personality, the aunties were appalled. they whispering with each other. One of the aunty said, “Whenever the young lady talks a lot, you know she’s real mad.”
</p>
<p>
Muffled gasps could be heard across the kitchen. The new maidservants who weren’t that familiar with Bhela Malikh nodded absent-mindedly as if they had a shocking revelation.
</p>
<p>
Bhela pretended not to hear that, despite her sharp perception catching all the sneak whispers passing around in the kitchen. She was occupied occupied with filling the ceramic plates with hot chicken curry, when suddenly, a rare smirk flashed on her face.
</p>
<p>
“S-something wrong, young lady?” the little maidservant asked.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, no. It’s just this curry remind me of my dear friend who likes eating a lot.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Gasp!</em>
</p>
<p>
This time, the aunties didn’t bother to muffle their surprised gasping.
</p>
<p>
“F… f…” the pudgy aunty muttered with trembling lips, “friend?”
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela finally has a friend?”
</p>
<p>
“But that imposs--”
</p>
<p>
That even ruder than Elder Jhamil’s son talking crap. The maidservant who said the last words immediately cover her mouth with her two hands, scared when her eyes met with Bhela’s sharp gaze.
</p>
<p>
Once again, as the model Young Lady of Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh was big-hearted enough to pretend not to hear that. She continued filling the plates as if the aunties’ gossip was none of her business.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Not long after the commotion happened in Malikh Family’s kitchen, Shira and Mila, the only guests coming as the scions of Yashura Family, arrived at the Malikh’s main gate.
</p>
<p>
The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few of stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. Usually the gatekeepers would greet the guests from other big families with beaming smiles and slippery flattery gestures. However, Malikh Family’s gatekeepers on duty stared at Shira and Mila coldly. One of the gatekeepers even snorted when his eyes met with Shira’s. 
</p>
<p>
“Ridiculous!” she hissed with face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect.
</p>
<p>
Mila crossed her arms. “Hmph. You should’ve bring that sword, I saw this coming miles away. If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they see us Yashura coming.”
</p>
<p>
Shira shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the <em>rendang</em> to?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.
</p>
<p>
“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.
</p>
<p>
Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsen when it came to Shira Yashura.
</p>
<p>
“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Are they drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent?”
</p>
<p>
Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, Yashura Family would be dreaming to get Young Lady Bhela to their side. Pueh!”
</p>
<p>
Hearing the muffled whispers, Mila Yashura’s brows twitched. She whirled her body, glaring people with eyes of eagle. “Who said that?!” she growled.
</p>
<p>
“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder back. 
</p>
<p>
Mila scoffed as her face turned fiercer.
</p>
<p>
“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Just let go, Mila,” Shira said. He showed the banana leaves wrapped <em>rendang</em>, then continued, “let’s give this <em>rendang </em>to them and get out of here. All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our <em>rendang</em>. Whether they received it or not, that’d be an issue for Uncle Shuro to think about another day.”
</p>
<p>
Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped for Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it so he had an excuse to eat his uncle’s <em>rendang </em>for himself. He didn’t have to worry about what to eat for tomorrow’s breakfast that way.
</p>
<p>
A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh. These young women brought ceramic plates food with them, as if they were announcing themselves as the followers of Malikh Family’s tonight Chief Chef.
</p>
<p>
“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured. They were the same age but all he did was helping some uncle hunter to butcher some goats. Sole daughter of the patriarch to present herself as the Chief Chef of ngajen ceremony was unheard of. The sight made people talking about various things. The boys--the horny boys with wolf pelts--were over the moon looking at her grace, while the girls--the likes of Mila Yashura--hissing endless curses of jealousy with sneaky low voices. Most older people only shook their head, thinking the arrangement was a bit inappropriate, though some felt it wasn’t that unreasonable for Malikh Family to be too excited after knowing a Unique Class appeared in their family.
</p>
<p>
“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him. Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was a monkey-like faced man, Monkey.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” Mila asked Shira.
</p>
<p>
“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly. Minus his awkward shaped face, this guy actually had a good social skill. Mila nodded weakly as she didn’t put any effort to print him in her mind. With that combination of face and awkward name, it was harder to forget than putting effort to remember someone like Monkey.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s a foreigner. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.
</p>
<p>
“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his situation. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master, but then Snake met with his relatives. Who would have thought the relatives actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s ngajen ceremony? He’d gone chatting with his family right now.”
</p>
<p>
Mila butted in and asked Shira, “You have some business to attend, no?”
</p>
<p>
“Not really,” Shira replied.
</p>
<p>
“Really, though? I saw Romana just now. I’ll chat with her a bit. You’ll do your thing, okay?”
</p>
<p>
It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony, was not to have fun. He didn’t like it but he didn’t have the right to stop Mila either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”
</p>
<p>
No, Shira actually more worried about her than himself. Mila went without a care, waving her hand as soon as Romana saw her on the opposite side of the crowd.
</p>
<p>
Glancing beside him, Shira called, “Mister Monkey.”
</p>
<p>
“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? Where is he?”
</p>
<p>
“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. With his thumb he pointed at a certain direction. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather. They wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. The old man who likely to be Snake’s grandfather had an old white hair and long beard. He supported his crooked back with a walking staff and the light in his eyes were dim, giving people an expression of sleepy old man. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face paler than when Shira met him in the market.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira murmured.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.
</p>
<p>
The sleepy-looking old man, noticed two pairs of eyes were looking at him, raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.
</p>
<p>
“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.
</p>
<p>
“He’s heading this way…” Monkey was unsure whether he voiced it out as a question or not.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yes, apparently,” Shira agreed.
</p>
<p>
Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”
</p>
<p>
Shira of course knew that. Although Monkey didn’t say much about Snake’s family, he had the general idea that Snake actually hailed from a prestigious family. Even if it was his uncle the patriarch he’d need to bow before a random elder from that kind of family. A young master from a country place like Badril Village couldn’t afford to offend this weak-looking elder. Thus the Young Master of Yashura Family better get his act straight.
</p>
<p>
“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached. He offered his greeting, asking to kiss the back of the old man’s right hand like any filial Mossack youngsters would do to give respectful greeting for their elders. He did it without any hesitation, which surprised Monkey who had already became a timid ape standing behind him. Kissing an elder’s hand might show the highest form of respect, but if he got rejected, Shira’d make a fool out of himself. Monkey couldn’t be sure whether it was the boy’s own gut or his obliviousness was beyond cure.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the old man didn’t reject Shira’s good intentions. Instead, still with a smile plastered on his face, the elder nodded, patting Shira’s head, then said, “Ah, Young Master Shira, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday I looked how happy you were running around just like other little kids.”
</p>
<p>
Shira nodded hearing that. He grinned, a confused grin, then stole a glance to a flastergabbed Monkey behind him.
</p>
<p>
So you knew him from the start? That was how the look on Monkey’s face screaming. 
</p>
