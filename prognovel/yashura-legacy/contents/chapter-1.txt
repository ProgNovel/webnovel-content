<p>
A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control the boy’s mortal body.
</p>
<p>
More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lose even once. And that made the spirit grew more dissatisfied as the days passing by.
</p>
<p>
“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.
</p>
<p>
The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuses every time the chess game coming to its end.
</p>
<p>
The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.
</p>
<p>
“Fuck this shit!!!”
</p>
<p>
Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen of chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ending up abandon all these easy-money making game.
</p>
<p>
“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”
</p>
<p>
As annoyed as he was, the spirit couldn’t do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.
</p>
<p>
“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”
</p>
<p>
The spirit scoffed.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”
</p>
<p>
“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that coming around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”
</p>
<p>
“Then use it to add your saving,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreeness. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called as a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressing spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of. Nalaq were those the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, the strong people who had high-level and had their own way to preverse their spirit before death. They’ve got their own consciousness and retained their memories and intelligence, though part of their original power disminished. Meanwhile, Selaqs were different bunch of strong people. Their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres. 
</p>
<p>
Theoritically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at these vulgar grinning spirit.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.
</p>
<p>
“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real indentity.”
</p>
<p>
“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”
</p>
<p>
“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s indentity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thining southern Mossack hetirage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerners tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunterers and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞
</p>
<p>
On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which ridicilously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit who recently lost a pouch of foreign coins to a certain boy took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people, but converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner, usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. However, this spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for ciggerattes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk worth to be admired or to be scoffed at.
</p>
<p>
The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. He liked mature women but interesting aunties with interesting big breasts and interesting big butts were a rare sight to see. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a troublesome ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit oogling for women that passing by.
</p>
<p>
There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes also not worth to be fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.
</p>
<p>
“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”
</p>
<p>
The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin. 
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.
</p>
<p>
“Ouch!” the manservant cried.
</p>
<p>
Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.
</p>
<p>
“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”
</p>
<p>
The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But recently, under the management of the family’s current patriarch, businesses went external, they was trying their hands the newly found ore veins and invested the village’s peddlers and merchants, which was surprisingly going well for this past decade. Because of that the hill mostly vacant during the dry season. Nowadays the only ones who came to the hill were occasional herb gatherers and a boy who seeked solitude and made it his own base--Shira Yashura.
</p>
<p>
“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaning in protest.
</p>
<p>
“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazying around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
“But they bother our family!”
</p>
<p>
Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”
</p>
<p>
Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging were biting his ass currently.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”
</p>
<p>
“You might not believe it but here I’m making profit faster than I’d get working part-timer in our family’s shop,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.
</p>
<p>
But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.
</p>
<p>
“By painting?”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commisioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vurnerable ladies being stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.
</p>
<p>
Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, was introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone who using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened may times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”
</p>
<p>
“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”
</p>
<p>
Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?
</p>
<p>
“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”
</p>
<p>
“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimatic. Although their age the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth enying for. The old generations called her treassure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.
</p>
<p>
“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”
</p>
<p>
“What about?”
</p>
<p>
“You still asking?”
</p>
<p>
The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.
</p>
<p>
“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages are in good-quality, you know what I mean?”
</p>
<p>
“From who did you hear that?”
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”
</p>
<p>
Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”
</p>
<p>
Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”
</p>
<p>
“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”
</p>
<p>
Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho. Jealous?”
</p>
<p>
“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”
</p>
<p>
After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walked without caring of the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle escaped from his mouth.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in public training field. The field, owned by the most influental family in Badril Village, neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would accur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two his lackeys.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field supposed to be free for everyone!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.
</p>
<p>
“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”
</p>
<p>
“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to the them.
</p>
<p>
The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”
</p>
<p>
“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.
</p>
<p>
The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned around and get lost.
</p>
<p>
“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right,” Polio added.
</p>
<p>
“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.
</p>
<p>
Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”
</p>
<p>
They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
</p>
<p>
It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.
</p>
<p>
From the three dilenquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”
</p>
<p>
Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.
</p>
<p>
Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”
</p>
<p>
Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enminity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascending the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.
</p>
<p>
“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.
</p>
<p>
Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.
</p>
<p>
“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.
</p>
<p>
“Pilek,” Bony called.
</p>
<p>
“Yes boss?”
</p>
<p>
“You should’ve been keep your mouth shut.”
</p>
<p>
Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worsen for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.
</p>
<p>
After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family. 
</p>
<p>
The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys thought she was disatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grown beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feeling curious about you.”
</p>
<p>
That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”
</p>
<p>
“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see about your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <strong>Archer</strong>, right?”
</p>
<p>
“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lippedly. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”
</p>
<p>
The remark made Bhela Malikh raised her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.
</p>
<p>
“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself are going to be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”
</p>
<p>
He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such a trash to become…”
</p>
<p>
The words stopped, Bhela looked at person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”
</p>
<p>
It was someone else who replied her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”
</p>
<p>
And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural place like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hardwork. Faster than that, not counting usage of unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation.
</p>
<p>
However, to think a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, it was no wonder everybody called him trash.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”
</p>
<p>
All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retracted her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched. 
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was she said.
</p>
<p>
The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to surpress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneous, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”
</p>
<p>
The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progressed with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoritically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more of years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who supposed to be guard the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd simply a bunch of coin machines.
</p>
<p>
“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”
</p>
<p>
No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shot three arrow one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that marked in red dot.
</p>
<p>
He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hitting hit the arrow in the red dot.
</p>
<p>
What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she used <strong>Far Sight</strong> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she used <strong>Boost Accuracy</strong>, the skill that supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shot.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Neither was I.”
</p>
<p>
With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents and said coldly, “If this is how Young Master Elzhier behaves, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”

Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”
</p>

<p>
Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place. 
</p>
<p>
It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.
</p>
<p>
She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with a dozens of arrow lying on it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow. She began to aim.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself being a weak newborn.
</p>
<p>
<em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Shuuuhsh--</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em>
</p>
<p>
The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the target at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reached two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrofying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flame as soon as the said arrow came to contact with them.
</p>
<p>
<em>Clap clap clap!</em>
</p>
<p>
Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you…” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguished the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to the a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.
</p>
<p>
“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.
</p>
<p>
Summoning a blazing fire just with arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.
</p>
<p>
Bhela drank a glass of murky liquidify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was way,” she said after put down the glass on the tray her maidservants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”
</p>
<p>
She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still to much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shooting one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.
</p>
<p>
The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”
</p>
<p>
The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”
</p>
<p>
“Are the Yashura Family elders still favor him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly becomes the next patriarch.”
</p>
<p>
“So no rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering, then?”
</p>
<p>
The maidservants shook their heads altogether.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent but you better cut tie with before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.
</p>
<p>
“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”
</p>
<p>
They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maidservants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.
</p>
<p>
“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversations ignorant of his presence.
</p>
<p>
After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.
