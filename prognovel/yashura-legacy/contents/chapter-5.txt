<p>
Everyone was taken aback by the sudden reveal of Bhela’s true talent, they didn’t realize the magic arrows were actually fatal if they hit Mila.
</p>
<p>
<em>Wyyuuunngg!</em>
</p>
<p>
Unexpectedly, the arrows that should’ve hit Mila suddenly vanished when, out of thin air, four lines of blue ribbon light pouncing at the speed almost as fast as the light itself. The ribbons merely formed with condensed mana, completely harmless to living being, yet when they came into contact with other mana related magic, the clashing mana energies would try to dominate and eat each other in a span duration less than it took to blink an eye. The theory behind it was simple, yet to actually pull it out, would require a great deal of skill. Eventually, the light ribbons canceled Bhela’s magic arrows.
</p>
<p>
“Ah!”
</p>
<p>
Mila was so surprised she slipped and fell onto her bottom.
</p>
<p>
Seeing that Mila still confused about what had happened, Bhela came forward and offered her a hand. “Are you okay, Young Lady Mila? I purposely make the arrows a bit slower so you can dodge them. So I don’t expect you to stand there doing nothing. Please be careful next time.”
</p>
<p>
Her words, although said with neutral and emotionless tone, was implied as calling Mila a brainless girl by the bystanders.
</p>
<p>
Mila slapped Bhela’s hand and stood up by herself. Looking at Bhela, she snorted, said, “Damn! What did you give your guests to eat?! My stomach is a little upset so that doesn’t count!”
</p>
<p>
Before Bhela thought something to say, Shira already came and pulled Mila’s shoulder. “Come on, Mila. You lost. At least admit that before people look down on you.”
</p>
<p>
Mila knew it was shameless for her to make an excuse when everyone already saw how helpless she was in front of Mila’s skill. Yet, when her eyes met with that cold, proud eyes of Bhela Malikh, the little pride left in her couldn’t bring Mila to say it. “Hmph!
</p>
<p>
Just when Mila threw away her face, Young Master Frane Blackwood came and said, “Village bums certainly doesn’t have any shame. You certainly don’t have any chance having a standoff with Young Lady Bhela. Why don’t you get the clue and scram back?”
</p>
<p>
“And who you are supposed to be?” Mila scoffed.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t have any obligation to tell village bum like you. But I will since everyone is perhaps feeling curious for someone like me came to visit this village,” he faced the crowd and proudly announced, “My name is Frane Blackwood, the eldest and Young Master of Blackwood Family. I came here to payback the favor my family owe to Young Lady Bhela for taking care of my young sister during the seminar these past two years.”
</p>
<p>
After saying that, the young noble gracefully bowed and kissed Bhela’s hand. The locals of Badril Village who witnessed the gesture a blue noble gave to one of their own made their pride inflated. Surely, even if Young Master Frane Blackwood didn’t explain the reason for his visit, people would still rather a polite, graceful young noble like him getting engaged to the talented Bhela Malikh instead of some talentless boy like Shira Yashura. 
</p>
<p>
Shira said, “I don’t know if you aware of this, Young Master Blackwood, but my Yashura Family has ties with Malikh Family. Your gesture to Young Lady Malikh might be common in where you’re coming from but here, we don’t have that kind of custom.”
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
Frane Blackwood blatantly didn’t put Shira in his eyes. Because of that, Shira reminded him again.
</p>
<p>
“I’m the Yashura Family patriarch’s nephew.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re that Level 3 Novice trash?” the young noble snickered.
</p>
<p>
Shira decided to ignore than and said unhurriedly, “This is Badril Village. We are very hospitable people. We love to be a host to many kinds of guests. We do, however, never take kindly to guests of the bad kind. It’s best for you not pushing our bottom line.”
</p>
<p>
The young noble of Blackwood Family chuckled at Shira’s warning.
</p>
<p>
“Am I supposed to listen to him, my young lady?” Frane asked Bhela.
</p>
<p>
Bhela said nothing, but she pulled back her hand from Young Master Frane Blackwood’s fingers. As a daughter of Malikh Family’s patriarch, how could she not know the heaviness of Shira’s words.
</p>
<p>
Seeing Bhela Malikh didn’t answer, a guest came forward and said, “Young Master Blackwood, what Shira Yashura said isn’t exactly true. Even though we have the village customs but we’re still the residents of South Tiramikal Kingdom. What Shira meant is for the foreign commoners to behave, it naturally doesn’t count for good noble like you.”
</p>
<p>
The villager’s voice was fawning. Shira smiled coldly at him. Thinking back again, Mila was right, all these villagers of upstart families only dared to flaunt around when Yashura Family hiding its claw. Back when his father Jhuro Yashura was here, even the most brazen members of Elzhier Family--who were riding the wind since the Village Head as their patriarch give them benefits and statuses--wouldn’t dare to headbutting against Yashrua Family even for trivial matters. Not to mention this person not from the three big families. He felt the Yashura who revered in the past had lost its dignity.
</p>
<p>
Frane Blackwood sneered at Shira. 
</p>
<p>
“You have a way with words, commoner.”
</p>
<p>
“At least I’ve said what I have to say,” Shira replied as he curled the corner of his lips.
</p>
<p>
“I’m very interested about a boy who’s supposed to be Young Lady Bhela’s fiancé,” Frane Blackwood said to Shira. “How about this, commoner. I’m a Level 13 Knight. Since your girlfriend propose my young lady to a duel, why don’t we do something to know each other too?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m his cousin!” Mila corrected. “And are you suggesting you want to know each other? You homo?”
</p>
<p>
“No, he means a duel,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
After he said that, snickers came from the crowd of guests. The didn’t mean to laugh at Mila’s joke, but the thing they found funny was a weak Novice like Shira acting tough in front of a noble Knight who obviously, no matter how shabby his talent was, would definitely be strong with expensive items and equipment.
</p>
<p>
For a Level 3 Novice trash to accept a duel against a Knight ten levels above him, that was the epitome of courting death.
</p>
<p>
Blatantly, Bhela Malikh said what everyone wanted to say, “You’re ten levels short against him. And a man with a Class is vastly different than a newbie still in Novice years. No way you’re going to win him in a fight.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” Shira looked at her, “is this Young Lady of Malikh Family show concern to her fiancé?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Bhela said without batting an eye. With that, Shira couldn’t help but smile wryly.
</p>
<p>
Young Master Blackwood smirked, “It’s a shame for Young Lady Bhela has to get engaged with someone like him.”
</p>
<p>
When the situation about to turn more lively, the expert from Elemental Stone School also couldn’t help but say the same thing.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela is certainly a talent that would come once every one hundred years,” the man from Elemental Stone School said as he approached them on his back. “Getting tied to a rural village like this would definitely a loss for everyone in Tiramikal Continent. I don’t know what the elders of Malikh Family thinking when they gave the young lady into a rushed engagement.”
</p>
<p>
“I appreciate your concern, Mister Harrington. But my father has his own reason,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right, young lady. It is too hasty for me to guess your father’s intention,” the expert quickly took back his previous remark as he nodded amiably. Before, he was arrogant and angry and Bhela had to be polite in front of him. But after witnessing the girl’s true potential, it was his turn to act careful to not upset this young talent named Bhela Malikh.
</p>
<p>
Young Master Frane Blackwood, on the other hand, was concerned about how Bhela refer the foreign guest. She called him with “Mister” even though his cloth was shabby and not worth mentioning. It was a custom for Mossack people to refer the foreign western ladies with title “Madame” and the title “Mister” for the foreign western men, granted they had a certain degree of status and dignity.
</p>
<p>
The Elemental School Stone expert’s companion, the middle-aged woman, also came to give her point of view, “Why don’t we use the duel as a test to see whether this young man worthy of being a fiancé of a Unique Class with unprecedented four elemental-affinity Archer?”
</p>
<p>
“This is my family’s matter, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela’s voice became a little stern.
</p>
<p>
“Not to say I want to meddle with your family’s affair,” the woman said. “But from the place where I come from a duel can be used to fight over a woman. Even myself married to a guy who had defeated my ex-boyfriend.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela didn’t say anything after that. The three revered guests, however, hoped Bhela to use this opportunity to ditch her hopeless fiancé. Married to a family in this village surely would harm Bhela Malikh’s future.
</p>
<p>
It was then, another person came up to join the little conversation. This person, a buffy man with a hearty laugh, patted Shira’s back as soon as he arrived. “Getting too lively, are we?” Snotty said.
</p>
<p>
“Young master!” the pair Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia greeted Snotty with their head lowered.
</p>
<p>
Snotty nodded at their greeting with a smile. Then he glanced at Mila and said, “Are you okay, young lady? Losing against a Unique Class with four elemental-affinity isn’t that shameful. Young Lady Mila, please don’t cry….”
</p>
<p>
“Do I looked like I’m crying?!” Mila hissed.
</p>
<p>
Snotty laughed again.
</p>
<p>
“I recalled I hear something like a duel for Young Lady Bhela’s favor,” he looked at Bhela’s two guests, the ones who had dissent on Shira’s and Bhela’s engagement. Then his eyes moved toward the young noble who arrogantly dressed himself better than his host, a trait which Mossack people didn’t like. He continued, “I reckon you feel good about yourself, young man, acting tough while only dare to fight a junior ten levels behind you.”
</p>
<p>
Frane Blackwood saw the two Mister and Madame acted respectful toward this muscle man. So he said cautiously, “This is not something an outsider should meddle.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m not exactly an outsider though. Young Lady Bhela’s great-grandmother asked my family’s help to treat Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s illness.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing her father’s had been treated, the light on Bhela’s eyes moved. “How is my father’s condition, young master…” she hesitated since she didn’t know his name.
</p>
<p>
“Call me Snotty, young lady,” Snotty said with an apologizing smile. “As for your father’s illness… my grandfather has checked him and we might need your great-grandmother’s pointer to continue.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh…”
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t be sad, Young Lady Bhela,” Snotty took out something from his pocket, “this is a cosmetic my grandfather’s personally made. Please accept it as a token of our apology.”
</p>
<p>
Young Master Blackwood didn’t like seeing Bhela receiving gifts from another man. A disatisfied snort rang out, not from the young noble, but from Mila Yashura. Shira immediately whispered beside her to keep her mouth shut.
</p>
<p>
“Young master,” the woman called Madame Sylvia approached Snotty, “you coming here, perhaps, are interested in participating the duel?”
</p>
<p>
“Haha, please don’t tell a joke, Madame. I’m twenty seven and already married with a baby son!”
</p>
<p>
Mila gasped. “You’re married?”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry to disappoint you, young lady. You’re too young for me so I go ahead marry a girl with a beauty you wouldn’t believe, haha!”
</p>
<p>
“Ueeekk!” Mila groaned in disgust. Who wanted to marry this muscle man? But Snotty’s laughter became more hearty by the minute.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” Snotty looked at Shira, “young master, do you think you can fight against this pompy young noble?”
</p>
<p>
“I can fight. But I’d lie if I could win,” Shira said.
</p>
<p>
“How about two months for now?” Snotty asked again.
</p>
<p>
Shira nodded. Honestly, if he didn’t have to fight, that’d be great. But he couldn’t refuse on his own. If people thought he was afraid of accepting the duel, the one who disgraced would not only him, but also Yashura Family behind him.
</p>
<p>
And just like that, the duel between Shira Yashura and Frane Blackwood settled in two months. The two experts Bhela invited also wouldn’t say anything as long as Snotty handled the affair. Still they thought two months would be a waste of time, since there was no way for a boy of fifteen years old would catch up in ten levels merely in two months. Even if Shira could manage it somehow--which they felt impossible--there was no guarantee for him to get a combat Class after he graduated from Novice. Considering the opponent was a Knight, which might be experienced in duel combats due to the nature of his Class, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances and shook their head at the same time; any chance for this young master of Yashura Family standing proud after the duel was nill. They returned to their seat after the bulky Snotty shouted to disperse the curious bystanders. Bhela Malikh went back to help with the ceremony while Shira and Mila decided they had enough with the Malikhs, they returned back to Yashura Family.
</p>
<p>
“What the hell is going on?” Young Master Frane Blackwood hissed when there was nobody around him except his adjutant.
</p>
<p>
“It seems the big man who calls himself Snotty also isn’t in guest list Elder Jhamil invited,” the adjutant said.
</p>
<p>
“I know that, I know Bhela’s great-grandmother who invited them to treat her father!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s… did they succeed?” the adjutant asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No, of course not,” Frane snorted. “Mother assured the poison is incurable. How could a no background family like Malikh succeed on curing something like that?”
</p>
<p>
The adjutant apologized as he realized his anxious question made the young noble into a bad mood. 
</p>
<p>
Currently the Young Master Blackwood and the adjutant, along with an obedient servant who standing waiting like a wooden statue, were in a separate room Elder Jhamil provided beforehand--which, naturally, the most extravagant room, the one that supposed the patriarch’s personal use.
</p>
<p>
Not long after the young noble enjoyed the best meal Malikh could provide, a visitor came knocking, and the obedient servant immediately opened the door before going back to stand like a statue. The visitor was Elder Jhamil’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Greetings, great young noble!” he excitedly greeted, almost yelling.
</p>
<p>
“Cut the flattery. Young master doesn’t want to be bothered so you can tell me the business you come for,” the adjutant said.
</p>
<p>
“My father Elder Jhamil sent me to inform you, that the ngajen ceremony has come to an end. The closing part of the ceremony was us locals sending food to the mountain to give our offering, so that our Badril Village will be saved from haunting Selaqs until the next month.”
</p>
<p>
The adjutant glanced at the young noble who was eating and couldn’t be bothered with it.
</p>
<p>
“What your ceremony has to do with us?” the adjutant asked Elder Jhamil’s son.
</p>
<p>
“It’s like this, sir,” clearing his phlegm, Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “currently, Young Lady Bhela Malikh is coming along with the groups that send the offering to the mountain. However, we somehow heard she has some other plan right after the ceremony ended. The foreigners she invited now are in a hall she booked using her father’s name--it seems she wants to have a private discussion with the foreigners…”
</p>
<p>
“Private discussions?” the young noble’s ears twitched hearing that. His face changed, and the adjutant also realized it was a bad news for them.
</p>
<p>
“Young master… apparently Young Lady Bhela wants to offer her talent to the highest bidder…” the adjutant weakly said.
</p>
<p>
“Shut up! I know what it means!” Young Master Blackwood slammed the dinner table. Still angry, he pointed fingers at the Elder Jhamil’s son face, yelling, “where’s Elder Jhamil?!”
</p>
<p>
“He’s… he’s leading the elders and priests climbing the mountain,” the elder’s son stuttered, “he said he’d come back in half an hour…”
</p>
<p>
“Then get me inside the hall where they’re going to have discussion! They absolutely can’t start without me!”
</p>
<p>
Although he cried furiously, inside, Young Master Blackwood felt nervous. Blackwood Family took their sweet time to get Bhela Malikh to their side. They planned meticulously. Slipping inside by buying out people in Malikh’s elders line-up wasn’t easy, not to mention his mother even reached out for the creepy uncle of his to get the Malikh Family’s patriarch fell ill and decreased his influence.
</p>
<p>
“Us Blackwood Family are the one who find out Bhela’s real talent. We can’t afford people snatch her under our noses! You hear me?!”
</p>
<p>
The adjutant nodded vigorously. He wasn’t afraid by the young master’s anger, but he knew if tonight’s failure fell into him, the madam back in Blackwood manor wouldn’t go easy on punishment. Therefore, even if it would kill him, the adjutant must prevent the others from getting their hands on Young Lady Bhela Malikh!
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
Although Elder Jhamil had been flexing his influence over Malikh Family’s politics, there were still Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s fervent supporter he couldn’t buy. 
</p>
<p>
Ever since the patriarch fell ill, these good elders had been listening to the patriarch’s wife. Sadly, Madam Malikh always on the edge and thus hadn’t been speaking much with them lately. Hearing so little from the above, some people began to doubt whether the patriarch’s faction could hold a bit longer. They knew the madam wasn’t the type that could manage political affairs. It was fortunate that their young lady was sensible, and when the words get around on how she got herself as the Chief Chef of the ngajen ceremony, some people found hope. Therefore, when Young Lady Bhela came to them asking a private hall to host her guests, the leader of those elders quickly prepare a decent place for her to use. The leader of Patriarch Malikh’s supporter was a good-natured middle-aged man named Elder Khasim.
</p>
<p>
While the hall was decent, however, to host foreign experts the hall wasn’t enough. But Bhela could only accept Elder Khasim’s good intention as it was. To get a better hall she had to go through Elder Jhamil, something that she wasn’t willing to do.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela, welcome home.” Elder Khasim had been waiting for Bhela Malikh at the gates for her return. He was more respectful to the young lady more than other elders because he was an old follower of the late old patriarch, Bhela’s grandfather, a loyal supporter of Malikh main family. “How’s the mountain? The Selaqs have been calm, I reckon?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Fortunately, the other families have been diligent. The Selaqs don’t get angry,” Bhela said. She followed the elder to the prepared hall. “The guests have settled, elder?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, young lady. They don’t give any dissatisfaction when I showed them to our shabby place. It all thanks to you, they even show a bit of respect to this old man, hoho.”
</p>
<p>
Although Malikh Family hadn’t had land as big as Yashura and Elzhier, their land still was big enough they had to walk for a while to get to their destination.
</p>
<p>
“Young lady…” the elder hesitated, he had something to say and wasn’t willing to let go of the girl before he spoke it out. “Are you planning to talk with your parents about how you took the position of the chief chef?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think I would. My mother worried a lot about my father’s condition. Decreasing the burden from my parents’ plate is the most important thing I can do as a daughter.”
</p>
<p>
“Then how about taking it a step further, young lady? I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but the supporters of young lady’s father are being confused and anxious from lack of instruction from main family…”
</p>
<p>
“If there’s something I could help, please do tell me,” Bhela said. “But if you asked me to enter the political scene, elder, then I’m afraid I can’t help you.”
</p>
<p>
From the era of ancient Mossack hunters and gatherers, the southerners always let the adults making decisions for their families, villages, and tribes. That meant the youngest person in the political scene would be eighteen years old, and even that they mostly didn’t take the youngsters seriously; while sixteen, at most, the young people could only watch from the sideline by helping the elders as interns. Bhela this year only a fifteen years old girl. Unlike her venture in taking over the kitchen as the chief chef before, slipping into the political scene, for her, not only would need to get approval from the Malikhs, but from other families in the village as well. Her status as the family’s legitimate young lady wouldn’t help in this case. Malikh Family had once disrupted Badril Village around a century ago by appointing a matriarch to lead the family. But that only worked out because the matriarch herself, a widow of then recently late-patriarch, was a remarkable woman of steel--so remarkable the villagers even still remembered her as the Iron Lady of Malikh Family. She took the opportunity from “make it or break it” situation of Malikh Family to become the third major power of Badril Village. Bhela Malikh, although her talent and potential as an Archer of Unique Class was immeasurable, doubted she had the same temperament as the matriarch from one hundred years ago. Honestly, Bhela wasn’t even sure why the elder brought that up in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Elder Khasim naturally saw the young lady’s doubt and quickly explained, “You don’t have to take the elder mantle like us older people, young lady. You don’t even need to manage us if you don’t want to. What we need young lady for is that you bless us with your presence, just by having breakfast with us every morning in the family hall.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” Bhela nodded as she understood. What the elder needed wasn’t necessarily a substitute for her father’s absence, but a mascot for the supporters’ morale. The politics of Mossack people also relied on food, especially when they gathered to enjoy their meals, so daily events like having breakfast and dinner amongst the political circle hold meanings depending on who mingled with who. By having the young lady with them, the main family supporters would still able to hold ground against Elder Jhamil’s faction. Bhela Malikh’s potential was like that, everybody wanted to get on her good side even if she would get married to another family in less than five years.
</p>
<p>
In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink, and some roasted peanuts to chew, perfect for to accompany an idle night. They were respected elders in their respective factions. And in spite of their status, however, they were waiting for Bhela Malikh to finish her business on the ngajen ceremony calmly.
</p>
<p>
“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips. 
</p>
<p>
Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?” 
</p>
<p>
The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”
</p>
<p>
Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.
</p>
<p>
“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.
</p>
<p>
The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”
</p>
<p>
Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.
</p>
<p>
The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”
</p>
<p>
The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.
</p>
<p>
“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.
</p>
<p>
Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.
</p>
<p>
“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.
</p>
<p>
“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
But not of the adults believed her words easily.
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.
</p>
<p>
“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.
</p>
<p>
Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”
</p>
<p>
Bhela prostated.
</p>
<p>
“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.
</p>
<p>
Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.
</p>
<p>
“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”
</p>
<p>
Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”
</p>
<p>
“Anything?”
</p>
<p>
“Anything.”
</p>
<p>
The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.
</p>
<p>
It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”
</p>
<p>
“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.
</p>
<p>
“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”
</p>
<p>
With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave. 
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”
</p>
<p>
“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”
</p>
<p>
The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--
</p>
<p>
“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.
</p>
<p>
He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant  behaviour of this young noble completely diseregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”
</p>
<p>
Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”
</p>
<p>
“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”
</p>
<p>
<em>Zziiing!</em>
</p>
<p>
With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.
</p>
<p>
“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”
</p>
<p>
Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”
</p>
<p>
“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.
</p>
<p>
“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific of terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregard Young Master Blackwood’s offers.
</p>
<p>
Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for the advice…”
</p>
<p>
Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.
</p>
<p>
“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.
</p>
<p>
And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”
</p>
<p>
Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”
</p>
<p>
“How about me?”
</p>
<p>
Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.
</p>
<p>
Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.
</p>
<p>
The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”
</p>
<p>
“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?
</p>
<p>
Absolutely not!
</p>
<p>
“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”
</p>
<p>
“Y-young master--”
</p>
<p>
“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”
</p>
<p>
The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.
</p>
<p>
“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”
</p>
<p>
If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.
</p>
<p>
Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.
</p>
<p>
“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.
</p>
<p>
“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”
</p>
<p>
“She is in her room…”
</p>
<p>
“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”
</p>
<p>
The adjutant gulped before he replied.
</p>
<p>
“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”
</p>
<p>
So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.
</p>
<p>
A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.
</p>
<p>
“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”
</p>
<p>
The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.
</p>
<p>
The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.
</p>
<p>
“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”
</p>
<p>
Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.
</p>
<p>
“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”
</p>
<p>
“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”
</p>
<p>
“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”
</p>
<p>
He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.
</p>
<p>
Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”
</p>
<p>
“How did you know?”
</p>
<p>
“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”
</p>
<p>
“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”
</p>
<p>
“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.
</p>
<p>
But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.
</p>
<p>
“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”
</p>
<p>
“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.
</p>
<p>
The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”
</p>
<p>
After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.
</p>
<p>
On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.
</p>
<p>
“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”
</p>
<p>
“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”
</p>
<p>
“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”
</p>
<p>
“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”
</p>
<p>
Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.
</p>
<p>
“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re joking? You serious?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe. 
</p>
<p>
“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.
</p>
<p>
“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.
</p>
<p>
After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking <em>tuak </em>while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the <em>tuak </em>bottle and refilled their cups when empty.
</p>
<p>
“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.
</p>
<p>
“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”
</p>
<p>
“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.
</p>
<p>
The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.
</p>
<p>
“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”
</p>
<p>
“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.
</p>
<p>
“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”
</p>
<p>
Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.
</p>
<p>
“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”
</p>
<p>
Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.
</p>
<p>
“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.
</p>
<p>
“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.
</p>
<p>
The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.
</p>
<p>
“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”
</p>
<p>
“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.
</p>
<p>
“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.
</p>
<p>
Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.
</p>
<p>
After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden. 
</p>
<p>
When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.
</p>
<p>
“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed. 
</p>
<p>
“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”
</p>
<p>
Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”
</p>
<p>
“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.
</p>
<p>
While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”
</p>
<p>
Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.
</p>
<p>
Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.
</p>
<p>
“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”
</p>
<p>
Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.
</p>
<p>
“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.
</p>
<p>
“I know, I know--for emergency.”
</p>
<p>
The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.
</p>
<p>
Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.
</p>
<p>
In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.
</p>
<p>
“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.
</p>
<p>
“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.

Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.

<p>
<em>Flap flap flap!</em>
</p>
<p>
The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.
</p>
<p>
A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.

<p>
“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.

“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”
</p>
<p>
“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”
</p>
<p>
The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”
