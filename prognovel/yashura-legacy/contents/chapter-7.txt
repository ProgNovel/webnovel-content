<p>
In Badril Village, lived two friends who were as close as blood sisters. One had her posture clean, straight, noble--her spotless white face shone like gem, and she moved as graceful as a beautiful swan. 
</p>
<p>
The other one had a pair of curious, big googly eyes--coupled with her svelte neck yet plump cheeks, she looked like that one cute, hyperactive village girl if she was in plain clothes. 
</p>
<p>
The former one was prideful; she strived to be an excellent lady with her gifted talent. While the other girl, she had always been a playful one; the kind of girl that would slip away to play whenever left unchecked. The prideful Bhela never said it, but the playful Lyla knew that both of them were happy to be able to be together again after the seminars they attended together ended.
</p>
<p>
During their idyllic time Badril Village, Bhela had heard the anxiety of her relatives and her allies regarding of Lyla’s presence. The minority were saying that Lyla, in spite of her status as a noble descent, was no more than a fodder, pretext for Butler Tim and the servants of Blackwood Family infiltrating Malikh Family. The unfortunate thing was that concern wasn't unfounded--indeed, Blackwood Family had been giving support to the opposing faction from the shadow, the tensions that previously shimmered in shadow began to surface. Some worried it was only a matter of time it burst into conflict. Yet, contrary to her aloof appearance, Bhela regarded ties of her friendship very seriously; everyone who had warned her out of good intention left shaking their heads helplessly after finding out the plan that Bhela had in mind. As Lyla was very excited and looking forward to explore the fun life that Badrill Village could offer, Bhela found herself weak and wasn’t willing to let Lyla down.
</p>
<p>
After she was done with her chores, Bhela used the little spare time she had before archery training to write a single letter. This letter was to be sent to a long friend of hers, who she hadn’t met almost ten years. 
</p>
<p>
And naturally, as Elder Jhamil’s influence was powerful enough for him to monitor the letter coming in and out in Malikh Family, he was alerted by the letter Bhela Malikh had sent.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, a letter? So she has more connections outside?” Butler Tim asked with one of his brows raised.
</p>
<p>
“It’s actually the eldest Young Lady of Elzhier Family. Ten years ago, an expert was on a journey and accidentally found out that Elzhier Family had some talent suited for her sect. She was recruited back then, everyone was talking about it for months since she was the first one of Badril Village who was going to study overseas.”
</p>
<p>
Maybe because his face showing a trace of concern, the maidservant who was waiting for Butler Tim quickly poured a cup of tea for him to ease his throat. Elder Jhamil, who was also sitting at the same table as Butler Tim, raised his empty cup toward the maidservant. He smiled as he wordlessly asked for his cup to be refilled. But the maidservant blatantly ignored him, acting as if this elder was empty air.
</p>
<p>
“Is this something that I should be careful about, hmm?” sipping his tea, Butler Tim then asked Elder Jhamil. 
</p>
<p>
“N--no, from the way Elzhier Family behaved these past few years, I don’t think so.”
</p>
<p>
Butler Tim also didn’t pursue the matter any further. Even if the girl really studied in a sect somewhere in rich western kingdom, really, what a country bumpkin could do in the city? Even those with talents, if they couldn’t keep up with the nobles whose resources were endless as the ocean, all country bumpkins could do was step aside to make way for the privileges.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a capable man, Elder Jhamil. I’ll be waiting for a report about the letter’s reply in a few days time.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, Butler Tim, you can always rely on me!”
</p>
<p>
Butler Tim nodded in satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“Good, then if nothing else, I’ll be going.”
</p>
<p>
He stood up and began to walk out from the room. The tea serving maidservant followed him in a docile manner. When no one was around, Elder Jhamil who still in the room poured him a glass of tea, and picked the biscuit from the snack container. “Ahhh…” he sighed after he tasted how delicate the tea was after he poured milk in it. Indeed, even the life of a butler of a noble family was comfortable. Life as the most influential elder in Malikh Family couldn’t even compare.
</p>
<p>
The letter Bhela sent, at least, would take several days depending how far the recipient was. Maybe even more than a week. So Elder Jhamil thought to himself that he should take it easy and enjoy life as Butler Tim demonstrated himself recently.
</p>
<p>
Never would Elder Jhamil and Butler Tim thought that they were wrong. They merely thought the only opponent they had was a fifteen years old girl with talents.
</p>
<p>
Thirty minutes after the courir was gone with the letter, a beautiful elder of Elzhier Family, along with a few maidservants, came to Malikh Family with food and snacks in their hands.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ohh! Elder Shyla, Malikh Family is honored to be graced by your presence!” Elder Jhamil immediately spouted his praise, despite his eyes couldn’t take off from the big things on the woman elder’s chest.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you and your tongue, Elder Jhamil!” the woman giggled charmingly. “I came here under my patriarch’s order. Yesterday, he regretted he had not preparing himself to receive dear noble as the Village Head of Badril Village. So Elzhier Family is here to send our token of apology to young noble miss, Lyla Blackwood!”
</p>
<p>
Originally, Elder Jhamil was excited upon hearing Elder Shyla came visiting the family, excited both in mind and <em>lower</em> body. However, as soon as he heard she came for the noble, Elder Jhamil began to hesitate.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, uhhh… Elder Shyla… you see, the noble is…”
</p>
<p>
“Is Young Miss Lyla won’t receive our token of apology?” Elder Shyla’s tone was sad, almost a whimper. Then she began to talk about something unrelated, “recently shops under my management hadn’t been doing well. If this goes on, coupled with my failure to apologize to Young Miss, maybe Patriarch Elzhier will revoke my elder title…”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil blinked. It was famous in Badril Village that Elder Shyla had gained her status as an elder flawlessly by her own ability--yet someone like her, someone with great ability and <em>very big</em> assets, had her own problems she struggled with.
</p>
<p>
“Haahh… I know I’m only living alone without a husband and has been… lonely,” she sighed melancholily--while not forgetting to swept her hair and “accidentally” flaunt her charm. “If only there’s someone who is reliable enough to lessen my worry…”
</p>
<p>
Her charms really breathtaking. Elder Jhamil found himself gulping. Stammering, he then said, “E-elder Shyla, don’t be sad, I’m only considering that if the noble is resting or not. But, but… if you really need to apologize to dear noble… maybe I can ask whether the young noble lady is available!”
</p>
<p>
Elder Shyla’s eyes brightened. She clapped once, then she exclaimed, “Really, Elder Jhamil, you can?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, of course, if the noble’s being troubled then it’s all on me!” Elder Jhamil thumped his chest proudly. “Please, Elder Shyla, please sit and drink this tea with milk and biscuits and wait as I’ll get you some good news. Please wait!”
</p>
<p>
As if he was injected with chicken blood, Elder Jhamil bolted through the Malikh Family. He wasn’t looking to ask about the noble like he promised, but he came to his son instead.
</p>
<p>
He asked his son, “Is your mother home?”
</p>
<p>
His son then replied, “No, she’s outside gossiping again. I saw her with her gangs before, maybe she’ll back when the sun about to set like the usual.”
</p>
<p>
“Great!” Elder Jhamil was so happy he almost jumped. “Maybe today I’ll get a chance of my lifetime!”
</p>
<p>
Elder Jhamil was excited, so excited that he failed to notice, in Elzhier Family, Patriarch Elzhier had never sent anyone to apologize to the noble. In fact, Patriarch Elzhier wasn’t even aware Elder Shyla was visiting Malikh Family.
</p>
<p>
A maidservant of Elzhier Family walked on the corridor where it was usually off limit for the outsiders. When a Malikh Family elder noticed her, she said her objective, revealing the content of the tray she held--pastries, sweet wet snacks, and a few kinds of food as gifts. She intentionally mentioned that Elder Jhamil, who was chatting happily with Elder Shyla of Elzhier Family, already gave his consent. And just like that, this unassuming maid was able to reach the most unreachable part of Malikh Family: Bhela Malikh’s private archery field.
</p>
<p>
Bhela was training her archery when the Elzhier Family’s maidservant came. Realizing there was a visitor, Bhela put down her brows and wiped her sweaty face with a towel.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela, we’ve received your letter. Eldest Young Lady sent me here,” the maidservant said.
</p>
<p>
Bhela came to receive the tray from the maidservant. There were other two maidservants who were waiting for Bhela, they quickly prepared the table--which usually used to lay arrows and Bhela’s bows. Pretty soon, the table was full of delicious snacks.
</p>
<p>
“This young miss, please sit down also,” Bhela asked the maidservant.
</p>
<p>
With an ambiguous smile, the maidservant replied, “Young lady, I’m only a servant.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela nodded as she understood. Although she said she was only a servant, Bhela knew she wasn’t anything like a servant in a rural village like she said. And the fact that she hadn’t had been bothered by the time it took for her to get a reply just a mere thirty minutes, it showed that Bhela had encountered people with similar temperament as this maidservant whenever she tried to contact the Eldest Young Lady of Elzhier Family during her time in the seminars.
</p>
<p>
“We Mossack people consider rude to sit when our guest has to stand. So I’ll enjoy the treat while standing.”
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Bhela, you flatter me…”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mind if someone else join me on the table?” Bhela asked the Elzhier Family’s maidservant.
</p>
<p>
“Please go ahead. Officially, these foods are going to be sent to Young Lady Lyla as a token of apology anyway.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela was grateful. Even only glancing at the table someone like Bhela could notice some mixed foreign cuisines and biscuits on there, treats that were far more superior than the one Butler Tim gave her. And looking at them again, Bhela couldn’t help but felt familiar. She didn’t always remember what kind of food she ate, but she still could remember something that she ate on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
“Is this the same croissant they served in the seminars,” Bhela murmured after taking a bite.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Eldest Young Lady ordered the chef who made that croscant to live here in Badril Village. She said that you particularly enjoy croissant.”
</p>
<p>
It was hard to think for a chef, who usually baked cakes and croissants for nobles and heirs of royal families, to be recruited casually into a rural village like this. Yet again, as Bhela had witnessed more outrages events regarding the friend she hadn’t met for about ten years, she was numb to it.
</p>
<p>
“Lyla! Where are you? Come here a second!” Bhela then shouted.
</p>
<p>
Not far away from there, from the thick foliage behind the archer field, came Lyla’s impatient cried, “Nuuu!!! I’m busy over here!”
</p>
<p>
Bhela then said, “I’ve got croissants.”
</p>
<p>
“CROOOOISSAAANNNTTTT!!!!”
</p>
<p>
From the bushes leaped a silhouette of a girl. She bared her fangs, along with mouth leaking droll.
</p>
<p>
“CROISSANT?! DID I HEAR A CROISSANT???? WHERE?!!!” 
</p>
<p>
Bhela waved the buttery pastry at her.
</p>
<p>
“CROISSANT, I WANT!!!”
</p>
<p>
Lyla sprinted as if there was no tomorrow. Her face completely filled with dirt, hair tangled with leaves, leaving her dress--which was supposed to represent her noble house--completely messy and dirty.
</p>
<p>
“Which one is my share?” Lyla asked impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“You can eat how many as you want,” Bhela said.
</p>
<p>
It was dangerous for an ignorant person to utter that sentence to Lyla, but as Bhela already veteran in feeding Lyla with snacks and food, she of course what would happen next: the pastry on the tray completely gone, stuffed inside Lyla’s mouth. Her cheeks got puffed like a nut addict squirrel.
</p>
<p>
<em>Om nom nom nom</em>.
</p>
<p>
A rabbit hopped out of bushes. It looked around, then its eyes accidentally met with the swollen cheeks Lyla’s.
</p>
<p>
“Mwister Bwaanyy!”
</p>
<p>
The rabbit’s ears shot up in alert.
</p>
<p>
“Whwere dwo ywu want to gwo, Mwister Bwanny? Don’t rwan awway from meehhh!”
</p>
<p>
Not even she finished swallowing all the pastry she ate, Lyla already bolted again to chase the escaping rabbit. This was what happened if Lyla left unchecked, she just playing and, often times, suddenly rolling around on the ground for no apparent reason. Bhela knew Lyla couldn’t be this unrestrained back in Blackwood Family’s manor, so she let her be.
</p>
<p>
“You two, please make sure Lyla doesn’t hurt herself,” Bhela said to the maids who were serving her.
</p>
<p>
“Right away, young lady.”
</p>
<p>
That left Bhela and the maidservant from Elzhier Family. Bhela knew there was going to be a discussion where no one else supposed to learn.
</p>
<p>
The maidservant indeed brought a sensitive information with her. From her sleeve, the maidservant took out a scroll. “Young Lady Bhela, please take a look at this.”
</p>
<p>
The scroll was lite. Enough to hide it easily between clothes. But the content was anything but light.
</p>
<p>
“This is…”
</p>
<p>
The first thing she read was a profile of someone named Tim Krosslugan. Born and raised in a servant family, fated to serve the Blackwood Family since childhood. The scroll contained his level of education, wealth, connections he made over the years, along with recent bribes he made or received and the name of his current lover. Bhela frowned when she recognized the name of the lover written in it.
</p>
<p>
“Butler Tim… and that maid… are having an affair?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the maidservant who always serving him a cup of tea. In fact, they’re doing it in a room right in this moment.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela let out a soft groan. For them to neglect Lyla to this extent, even Bhela as the host was ashamed of their behaviour.
</p>
<p>
“What would you do, young lady?” the Elzhier Family’s maidservant asked with her ambiguous voice, almost as if her tone was floating, “the intruders were disrespectful toward Malikh Family. If you read the scroll further, then you’ll see an applicable move you can make right here, right now.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela read the next section, the tea serving maidservant’s name revealed. Although its content was lacking than Butler Tim’s, Bhela could see why the Elzhier Family’s maidservant recommended it. Turned out the tea serving maid’s lovers were not just Butler Tim, but some other people which one Bhela recognized--Frane Blackwood. That pompous Blackwood Family’s Young Master who always chasing her actually had a lover who was serving another man right inside his crush’s house.
</p>
<p>
“This is disgusting,” Bhela murmured.
</p>
<p>
“You can blackmail that butler. Although it’s quite usual for a noble young master to sleep with beautiful maids in his house, but that young master and the maid had their first time together a few years ago. So this maid’s position a little bit special.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela frown tightened. It wasn’t that she didn’t care about a scandal happening right in her roof, but for a maiden like her to confront scandalous adults wouldn’t be a good sight to see. And the fact that Butler Tim had been distracted, from too much scheming and too much doing scandalous things with the maid, could turn out to benefit Lyla. This Blackwood girl was drunk by freedom, as these past few days, no one from the Blackwood Family seemed to try stopping her from playing till her legs cramped and eating till her belly bloated like a pregnant young woman. The Elzhier Family’s maidservant guessed roughly what Bhela had in mind, thus she didn’t mention about the affair again.
</p>
<p>
“We also have complied the activities and unethical dealing of everyone under Elder Jhamil’s wings.”
</p>
<p>
As Bhela read it further, she couldn’t help but be amazed by how detailed the report was. Some corruption cases even dated back ten years ago, when Bhela still only a brat who didn’t even yet to realize how evil Elder Jhamil whom she called uncle. It wasn’t that difficult to end Elder Jhamil’s career with only this. If she went down to that route, however, the major problem would be to political upheavals that would follow. Her father’s condition was a little better since the ngajen ceremony, to force him to stand up from his bed and lead the family, Bhela didn’t want to see that happen. 
</p>
<p>
“Have you make up your mind, young lady?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Bhela said, “a toothless tiger is as scary as an oversized domestic cat. I will use your sect’s gift to disarm my political enemy. Please send my thanks for Sister Ryntia Elzhier’s kindness again, this time.”
</p>
<p>
In the end, she decided a softer measure, creating a balanced situation where Elder Jhamil’s faction weakened, but still not weak enough so that they still had their delusional ambition where they think they could swallow the entire Malikh Family by themselves.
</p>
<p>
The Elzhier Family’s maidservant seemed to expect this kind of decision coming from Bhela Malikh.
</p>
<p>
“Eldest Young Lady is your friend, Young Lady Bhela. It’s natural for us to take care of her friend,” the Elzhier Family’s maidservant said with her head slightly bowed. “But it is sadden us, Young Lady Bhela, to find out that you didn’t invite someone from our side on your little meeting during the ngajen ceremony.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah…” this was why Bhela felt reluctant to ask for a favor again from them. She felt like an ungrateful one who bitten the hand that feeding her. She bowed her body deeply as she said, “I’m sorry for single you out. Sister Ryntia had already done so much for me, but the sect she’s in is too far away from my family--so in this situation, I’ll surely rely on you if I don’t have any more alternatives.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you still have more alternatives?”
</p>
<p>
Bhela thought for a second. She shook her head in embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
“Our sect will gladly help your family, young lady. We don’t force you to join us or anything, just Eldest Young Lady will be sad if you act like strangers.”
</p>
<p>
“I will write something for Sis Ryntia. I’ll promise I’ll pay the favor that I owe in the future.”
</p>
<p>
“Eldest Young Lady will be waiting. And if nothing else… then,” the maidservant laid out a purple-ish colored bottle on the table, “please carry this for your protection, Young Lady Bhela.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela studied the bottle. She couldn’t help but confused by the sudden gesture. “May I ask… what this bottle does?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s our sect finest elixir for an exorcism.”
</p>
<p>
“Exorcism?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and it’s very potent. Remember yesterday’s explosion coming from Yashura Family’s area?”
</p>
<p>
Bhela blinked. Yesterday, there was indeed a commotion about an explosion coming from Yashura Family’s place. But Bhela didn’t expect that was caused by a simple bottle like this.
</p>
<p>
“Yashura Family hosts a very powerful… and very evil Nalaq, young lady. Young Master Shira Yashura even benefited a lot from having a connection with him.”
</p>
<p>
“He does?” Bhela tightened her brow.
</p>
<p>
“The rumors of him being a useless Level 3 Novice is already obsolete since that Nalaq gave him many good things.”
</p>
<p>
“This is unexpected,” Bhela said with displeased tone, “Yashura Family had always been upright for years.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t really say about Young Master Shira’s character, all I can say is that this Nalaq is a bad news. Our sisters have fallen victim to him many times. And as for you, Young Lady Bhela--” the maidservant stopped as her eyes swam to assess Bhela’s charming figure, “--you’re the type that the Nalaq likely to harass.”
</p>
<p>
Bhela’s face slightly perturbed.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, even the Eldest Young Lady is very concerned of your safety ever since she received the news of our sisters getting assaulted…”
</p>
<p>
“Were the victims okay?”
</p>
<p>
“They were okay since they escaped rather quickly as soon as the evil Nalaq showed himself. They are a group of professional, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I can only say my thanks again for your concern. I owe you twice today.”
</p>
<p>
The maid servant nodded.
</p>
<p>
“It seems I’m overstay your grace today, young lady. My sisters need me back for a mission today,” before she turned back, the maidservant gave Bhela one last warning. “No matter what, young lady, please protect your back against that evil Nalaq.”
</p>
<p>
“My back, yes, I will take extra care of my back--”
</p>
<p>
“No, young lady. Your back. Protect it well. I mean it.”
</p>
<p>
“O-okay…?” Bhela tilted her head in confusion. Did the maidservant tried to warn her that the evil Nalaq would come at the most unexpected direction--that was, her back? Looking at the maidservant’s serious face, she wasn't so sure anymore.
</p>
<p>
Even after the maidservant and Elder Shyla went back to Elzhier Family, Bhela still dazed staring at the exorcism elixir in her hand. Around an hour after that, Lyla returned, only because her legs were tired chasing the rabbit all over the place. Bhela dazedly staring still at the elixir.
</p>
<p>
“Yashura Family…” she murmured. Recalling a boy who was supposed to be her fiancé, her brows tightened, “having a contact with an evil Nalaq… what did he planned to do?”
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
A certain young master of the major family planned to get rich so that he had the chance to live a slow life as the Yashura Family’s patriarch in the future. Beyond that, he planned nothing.
</p>
<p>
And the supposed evil Nalaq, who brought himself by the name of Good-Natured Spirit, was basking in the sun while carelessly enjoying a painting of lady that got her bottom raised in an erotic pose. He was in the mood to appreciate women’s heavenly butts, thanks to the feisty unwanted visitors who blasted him with exorcism elixir. As a gentleman as Good-Natured was, he couldn’t get mad toward beautiful ladies--especially those with big boobs and big butts. Instead, he yearned to get to know them better.
</p>
<p>
“Man, those girls from Big Boobed Sect likely won’t come here for a while…” Good-Natured Spirit sighed. He rolled the semi-porn painting he had and put it inside a bag, which seemed magically swallowing the painting in spite of its small size. Then he picked up the cigarette he left on top of a rock, inhaling it for all the smoke worth left. He cocked up his head upside. Like an enlightened monkey, Shira Yashura tangled himself upside down on a tree branch, his eyes calmly closed.
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit ground the cigarette he had against the rock. “How is it?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I think I’m ready to level up,” Shira said, slowly opening his eyes.
</p>
<p>
He wasn’t talking about his level as a Novice. But about a peculiar <strong>passive skill</strong> he got from Good-Natured Spirit, of which he won by a fair game of chess about three months ago.
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit stood up. As a Nalaq, he usually floated, yet his feet glued to the ground as if the gravity once again accepted him as a living being that had a body mass.
</p>
<p>
“Come down a sec, let me test you.” After he said that, Good-Natured Spirit stomped the earth with his right foot. Three pebbles with similar sizes jumped, floating on the air, then wrapped by the same bluish aura as the hollowing energy that shrouded the Nalaq with. He grabbed the pebbles with a sweep of his hand--they reappeared between Good-Natured Spirit’s fingers hollow, with a trace of ethereal quality, the trait of objects that only spiritual beings like Nalaqs could interact with.
</p>
<p>
Shira, with his hairs tangled upside down by the gravity, asked with a frown, “You’re not trying to kill me, are you?”
</p>
<p>
“You’re saying you scared by pebbles?” Good-Natured Spirit scoffed.
</p>
<p>
“You heard the saying, right?”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit groaned. “Stop. I don’t like it when you’re being a smartass.”
</p>
<p>
“The saying goes,” Shira, closing his eyes again, said, “a single pebble could take a life if thrown by a brainless Nalaq.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s <em>thrown by a</em> <em>careless person</em>, you little fuck,” Good-Natured Spirit scowled. “Come down here so that I can see your progress on <strong>Water Flowing Style</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
Shira jumped from tree branch with a three hundred sixty degree flip--a move which a year ago he couldn’t hope to achieve. The <strong>Water Flowing Style</strong> Good-Natured Spirit gave him improved his athletic skill by a very large margin. But applied on him, a boy who’d rather use his brain than muscles, the result wasn’t that apparent if seen by untrained eyes. He never really used the skills he got from winning the bet against Good-Natured Spirit. That changed since he had a duel to fight with the Young Master of Blackwood Family.
</p>
<p>
“Really, I bet there’s going to be a ton of people coming to watch the duel, I need a way to get defeated in a way that won’t bring shame to Yashura Family…” he murmured.
</p>
<p>
“You’re talking about that duel? The one with that shitty face Blackgood-whut-you-call-it guy? Why defeat, though? Just smash his damn face, really, it’s easy if you wanted to.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s weird you called him ‘shitty face’, when that noble’s face resembles yours.”
</p>
<p>
“You said he looks like this handsome me?”
</p>
<p>
“I really thought he’s your descendant or something. Both the same--face and shamelessness alike.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit snorted. Ignoring the impudent boy, he then came back asking him, “You can mess that Blackdood guy’s face, even if you’re a shitty Level 3 Novice. Anything is possible with the help of this Ol’ Good Natured-Spirit. Seriously, I mean it. You believe me kiddo?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Ey, this is where you should reply with a ‘how’. Really, I tell you, if you follow my lead, I can give you a power beyond the <strong>System</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
“Ohhh…” Shira nodded unenthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
The power beyond the <strong>System</strong> only occured in myths. Level and Classes that had been the foundation of many orders, the systematic stats, said to be relevant and useless in front of it. Shira, as a rational young man, of course believed the possibility of this chaotic power beyond the order--but coming from this Nalaq, knowing from experience, Shira felt it was complete bullshit. 
</p>
<p>
“I knew you were interested,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms, smirked, “this is a training program I made myself. I called it ‘Training of Hell’. This is where you’re acquiring a cheat-like power, after all. Hence the cool name. By utilizing my thirteen thousands years of experience and knowledge, atop of the hellish sessions of training where you’ll tread in situations between life and death--”
</p>
<p>
“Nope, not interested. You’re going to lead me to death, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I need your soul intact in order to possess you. Why the fuck I’m going to do with your body if you’re dead?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, perhaps you’re holding a grudge after losing repeatedly in a game you brought on your own.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit stared at him. “I don’t like it when you look like you’re being a smartass.”
</p>
<p>
Shira shrugged. Ignoring the Nalaq, he took his stance.
</p>
<p>
“A’right, I’mma test you on your Water Flowing Style, then.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit prepared to flick his pebbles. And Shira didn’t plan to get hit. Although he only mastered Level 2 Water Flowing Style, Shira could already feel confidence seeped through his pores, a degree of confidence that almost to the point of euphoria, something that he almost never experienced himself.
</p>
<p>
“Yyooouuurrr sstaanceee--”
</p>
<p>
His sense being dragged in slow motion? Shira blinked, but he really did hear and really did see the time stretching as Good-Natured Spirit uttered something--
</p>
<p>
“--issss shiitttyyy.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Whhoooshh!</em>
</p>
<p>
The Nalaq flicked one pebble with his thumb. The pebble that infused with his bluish aura bolted through the air, slowly--no, it was as swift as a flying arrow but Shira’s perception caught the projectile in a slow motion manner.
</p>
<p>
Something coming deep from his subconscious, taking over his body seamlessly, then sending command to his motoric nervous system to slightly bending sideways--the flying pebble shot through the space between his arm and hip.
</p>
<p>
“Nnneeexxttt--”
</p>
<p>
The second and the third pebbles were coming. And like before, Shira avoid them in an effortless manner, moving only a mere inch more than it needed not to get hit by the Nalaq’s pebbles.
</p>
<p>
He managed to dodge both. But the last pebble, as Shira had to continue the Water Flowing Style’s flow, made him to spin one hundred eighty degrees backward. It was only afterward Shira realized the Nalaq forced him to turn his back on as the fourth pebble came and knocked his head.
</p>
<p>
“Kg-uggh!” Shira hissing as he rubbed his head. “Why the hell? It's supposed to be three.”
</p>
<p>
“When did I say I’ll throw three pebbles? But this is for your own good, y’know. Do you get the moral story about the fourth pebble?”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“If you’re trying to be a smartass, you’ll get fucked up indefinitely.”
</p>
<p>
“You asshole.”
</p>
<p>
“Ey, is that how you’re supposed to say to a revered Nalaq?”
</p>
<p>
“You said you’re not a Nalaq yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, now, let’s not so hasty reverted back to being a smartass again, will we? Lest, more ‘accident’ might happen… ‘kay?”
</p>
<p>
“Ughh…” Shira was fed up dealing with this Nalaq. “I’m going home.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit shrugged, then he rested his back on a tree. Shira thought a Nalaq couldn’t be more carefree than Good-Natured Spirit. From his mystic bag, Good-Natured Spirit took out a new painting that was more inappropriate than the one from before. He said to Shira, “Don’t forget to exercise your breathing, Water Flowing Style is all about your breath. Level 3 Water Flowing Style is on another whole level that Level 2. You already feel the difference, no?”
</p>
<p>
Although Good-Natured Spirit’s advice rarely did good--most turned out to be pranks, actually--this time Shira did feel the passive skill Good-Natured Spirit taught him had some sort of mysterious effect back when he dodged the Nalaq’s pebbles. Upon returning to Yashura Family, he decided to look for a Specialist who would show his <strong>Stats Window</strong>--the one who would do it free for him would be his cousin, Mila Yashura.
</p>
<p>
“Pah! How come your Wisdom goes up yet again? How many times do I have to tell you, you’ve got to have some muscles, put your effort on raising Strength and Agility!”
</p>
<p>
Yet, although it was free, it didn’t mean it wouldn’t incur any cost. If he wasn't careful Mila would nag him with full power, which depending on the weather and how the wind shifting her mood, the nagging could last half a day. Shira sighed inside his heart, if he knew Mila was on that time of the moon today, he would use his own money to get his Stats checked. Only, the last time he used outsider Specialist’s service, everyone in the village immediately knew that he was the only teen that still wasn’t better than ten years old kids.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going?” Mila crossed her arms when seeing that Shira trying to escape.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t done my share of today’s chores. Uncle and aunt have done so much for me… I’ll be doing my part of filial duty and do some errands right now….”
</p>
<p>
“Errands? You meant goofing around in the market?”
</p>
<p>
Shira groaned. If Mila was like this, he knew from experience the she wouldn’t let him off easily.
</p>
<p>
“Go to the field training, you’ve got to learn handling wooden swords,” Mila said. “Forget about errands. If you at least show even the slightest bit of motivation on preparing for your upcoming duel, then I’ll talk to my father about exempting you on daily chores.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been preparing myself, though.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you do?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been training on this wonderful skill called Water Flowing Style from a certain… mmm… master…?”
</p>
<p>
“Why fuck you tilting your head for? What kind of stupid master was willing to train you when all you do all day was lazing around alone on the hill?”
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t alone,” Shira said solemnly, “the Venerable Good Nalaq is always with me.”
</p>
<p>
Hearing the Nalaq was mentioned, Mila sucked the deepest breath out of her life.
</p>
<p>
Seeing that Mila subconsciously took a step backward, Shira didn’t let her off the hook. He turned his body and bowed apologetically to an empty air, said, “I’m very sorry about my cousin’s rude mouth, Sir Venerable Good Nalaq… she’s always dumb like this and never put any attention to her wording.”
</p>
<p>
Mila, although usually thoughtless of the consequence of her behaviour, she wasn’t born stupid. She knew very well the result of angering a revered Nalaq. Because of that, she immediately dropped her knees kneeling and begged for forgiveness. She begged forgiveness from the empty air.
</p>
<p>
“Have mercy, Sir Venerable Good Nalaq! I never thought you were so kind to bless this ignorant cousin of mine with your boundless knowledge. I’m very sorry to offend you with my uncouth mouth!”
</p>
<p>
Shira then pretended listened to the empty air, nodding off his head. “Mm. Sir Venerable Good Nalaq said you’re the one who were stupid.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes! Yes, I’m the one who was stupid! Let me punish myself by eating dirt so that I can appease Sir Venerable Good Nalaq!”
</p>
<p>
“Eh, you don’t have to do that,” Shira could see Mila was her father’s daughter. Even though in everyday’s life their personality completely different, sometimes, they just naturally alike in some aspects. “Just leave me alone for now. Sir Venerable Good Nalaq said the things he bestowed upon me are secret that he doesn’t want anyone to know.”
</p>
<p>
Shira could see Mila nodded in retreat. But knowing the girl’s personality, she’d find another reason to bother him by the end of the day.
</p>
<p>
He turned, only to find out that Butler Yulong saw all that happened. His expression was ugly.
</p>
<p>
“Uhh… Yulong, I think Sir Venerable Good Nalaq…”
</p>
<p>
Shira’s words were dragging, Yulong cut him off before he finished his sentence.
</p>
<p>
“Young Lady Mila acts like that because she worries about you, young master. You shouldn’t have teased her like that.”
</p>
<p>
Yulong had always been kind, the wrinkled smile he had always gave the impression of a gentle old grandpa. Butler Yulong always been responsible for his education more than his own father, who was rarely in Badril Village, and his uncle Shuro, who was taking care of him as the guardian. Therefore, whenever he got angry, Shira knew he’d better listened to him. 
</p>
<p>
Around that time, not far from Badril Village, a small coach took its time journeying through the mountainous road. 
</p>
<p>
The coach was a gray-haired middle-aged man, with magic sword on his belt, acting as the sole bodyguard for the two people inside. A mid-twenty young man was found sleeping there, while the other one, a girl around Mila’s age, was killing time by reading a lite novel.
</p>
<p>
“Hmm?” the girl found herself frowning, in spite of the novel’s content which was lighthearted romance. The man also felt a subtle change in her expression, forcing himself awake, became alert immediately. Ever since the girl made contract with her Nalaq, her own expression wasn’t necessarily reflecting her own emotion alone.
</p>
<p>
“Something wrong, Merly?” the young man asked.
</p>
<p>
With her fingers on her chin, still frowning, the girl replied, “Mama Ross tells me this place weirdly secure.”
</p>
<p>
The coach on the front replied instead, “Road to Badril Village is safe, young lady. A ferocious group of Road Warriors had been watching this route for about twenty years now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, for twenty years straight? Badril Village sure has some dedicated good Samaritans protecting their livelihood. I wonder if Yurin Family would be able to employ them,” the young man pondered.
</p>
<p>
“Haha, you can ask them, young master. Don’t you say you’re about to visit a family called Yashura, today? The founder of that Road Warriors is a man named Jhuro Yashura. He's been retired for fifteen years now, but still got enough influence to move his gang around--that’s the kind of man this Jhuro fellow is.”
</p>
<p>
“Hoo… if that’s true, even if Teacher Staterwind doesn’t get his third student here, our journey should be still worthwhile,” the man nodded in satisfaction. As a young master from a merchant family, he long knew how precious diligent Road Warriors to secure trading route in southern land infested with monsters and rogue bandits.
</p>
<p>
“Merly, why are you still frowning?” he asked the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Mama Ross said… it’s not about bandits, but an ancient formation. It was set here. Strong enough to hold against bombardment of Mages’ artilleries.”
</p>
<p>
It was almost as if the venerable Nalaq said this place was going to be an upcoming place for war. The man was silent hearing that. The coach, however, was a little doubtful, but he was polite when pointing out since the other party was a girl contracted with a venerable Nalaq. “That’s weird, Young Lady Merly. We’re far away from the border, and sure there’s no fortress built around here.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, Norman. Mama Ross the one who said that.”
</p>
<p>
The coach, Norman, could only nodded his head if the venerable Nalaq inside Merly’s body the one who insisted. 
</p>
<p>
They arrived at Badril Village about one hour later. Because the coach was made with a good wood, the party of Yurin Family was mistaken as the second visiting noble. The village head even enthusiastically welcomed them. The village head was disappointed, however, after knowing the new visitors were just random kids from a rich merchant family--since the Blackwood Family came, village head wanted to be the one who welcomed the noble, somehow. 
</p>
<p>
After asking around, the girl and the young man finally reunited with their teacher. Sir Baront rent them rooms at the inn he stayed. Then they came to discuss their business in the village.
</p>
<p>
“The Nalaq in this village doesn’t want to meet with Madame Ross,” Baront Staterwind said hesitantly, afraid he offending the Nalaq who resided inside his disciple’s body, “so I think we’ll try to talk a bit more with Yashura Family. They’re the one that host the Nalaq and their young master likely to be soul contracted. Jerrin, Merly, I’ll ask both of you cooperate with me later.”
</p>
<p>
The young man was Jerrin Yurin, a Level 19 Acolyte studied under Sir Baront Staterwind for seven years, while the girl, Merly Yurin, was a Level 10 Acolyte--a bit late bloomer considering she hailed from a rich merchant family, where access to resource like Boost Elixir was abundant. Today, they came to Badril Village under their teacher’s summon, discussing the possibility of designating Sir Baront’s third disciple.
</p>
<p>
“I do think they take us too lightly,” Jerrin said, not with an angry tone, but weren’t exactly sounded satisfied either. “I don’t have a contract with a Nalaq yet, but Merly’s got Madame Ross with her. Even noble families received us with better treatment than this.”
</p>
<p>
“Jerrin, you’ve got to understand, Yashura Family has an unidentified Nalaq living in their backyard--it’s understandable for them to worry more about a Nalaq that been living with them than us outsiders.”
</p>
<p>
The door knocked. Norman came to report of his findings about the soon-to-be third disciple.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve compiled a few points about Young Master Yashura that I deem important, please read this.” If nothing went wrong during their visit in Yashura Family, and Mama Ross approved the Nalaq from the other side, considering their teacher’s good mood, it was very likely that Jerrin and Yurin would receive the third younger brother to study under Blue Robe Society with them. So the coach was tasked to gather information about Shira. Although a Knight usually involved of crude fighting, duel, skirmishing, and occasional ball parties, the gray-haired man unexpectedly adept at information gathering due to his rich experience in guerilla warfare.
</p>
<p>
Reading the report, they noticed he was already engaged, which quite an unusual practice in southern lands. Merly knew the fiancée was, she remarked that, due to her promising talent and her rare Unique Class, Bhela Malikh was a celebrity during Merly’s trip in the seminars. Merly knew her from the rumors and stories her friends share with her, but hadn’t had the chance to meet with the said person because with Mama Ross’s existence, her schedule during the seminars was quite different than everyone else. Jerrin didn’t know that, but then Sir Barront told the story about what had happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony. Both of the disciples naturally formed their opinions.
</p>
<p>
“Both of you don’t have to worry, although on the surface this boy’s talent can’t be considered good, but I’ve met with him already. I can say that he’s a sensible young man.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right, Teacher Staterwind. The best talent an Acolyte of Blue Robe Society could have is to get favored by a Nalaq. He’s already far ahead than an uncontracted Acolyte like me in terms of talent and luck,” Jerrin said, jokingly mocked himself.
</p>
<p>
Yet although both the disciples weren’t satisfied with Shira’s low talent, spending time in Blue Robe Society, they understood that level and stats weren’t that import for an Acolyte with soul contract--the binding and conditions of their contract, along with their contracted Nalaq’s power, was what really matters.
</p>
<p>
Letting Jerrin and Merly spending two hours resting in the inn, Sir Baront Staterwind then sent someone to inform Yashura Family that they were coming. He knew Yashura Family was quite prepared with a banquet already, but a reminder wouldn’t hurt.
</p>
<p>
“This Yashura Family… are they living in the west or the east of the village?” Merly asked, a moment after they descended the inn’s stairs.
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront replied. “They’re on the east side. Yashura Family owns almost all the lands there. Why did you ask?”
</p>
<p>
“Mama Ross is concerned with something.”
</p>
<p>
The coach replied, “Young Lady Merly, Yashura Family is on the east side, while there are two families on the west side--Malikh and Elzhier. From what the locals said, those three major families seem to be normal.”
</p>
<p>
“Mama Ross doesn’t want us to mess with people in the west side,” Merly said, “but coming to the east, she’s not sure…”
</p>
<p>
There was nothing out of the ordinary when the party approached Yashura Family. But Merly Yurin found herself hesitate in taking another step forward--she felt Mama Ross’s restlessness inside of her. She straightened her head. An old butler was already standing by to welcome them.
</p>
<p>
“Welcome to Yashura Family,” Yulong said as he bowed his body. “We’ve prepared a little banquet to honor dear guests, please do follow me to the family hall.”
</p>
<p>
Sir Baront and Jerrin Yurin were often travelled the southern lands and experienced in being visitors of many families, thus they replied the greeting smoothly. The coach, however, saw from the back of the party the Young Lady Merly’s figure consciously avoid the butler. The coachman kept his finding to himself. In addition, he saw the butler realized the awkward gesture too, but Norman thought nothing of it.
</p>
<p>
***
</p>
<p>
For families of the southern Mossack that always throwing hearty feasts for whichever reasons they could come up with, serving beef on the table could be considered grand and lavish. Yashura Family were bigger rancher than Elzhier and Malikh Family combined, and they had the biggest plots of land in Badril Village, yet, a family this big, would only butcher cows only if the harvests of their rice paddies and other fields were abundant. 
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro Yashura spared no effort for this day, didn’t sleep all night just to prepare his best <em>rendang</em> for the guests. He put his soul as he slowly poured coconut milk over the cooking beef, giving all of his concentration to create a <em>rendang</em> that even better than all the <em>rendang</em> he made, combined. Wiping his brows, he looked toward the clear sky. Patriarch Shuro Yashura hoped that his Yashura Family could send their heir to study overseas like the young ladies from Elzhier and Malikh Family had--and, of course, he also hoped that there weren’t going to be an accident worse than yesterday's explosion would happen today.
</p>
<p>
In the family hall of Yashura Family, that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Yashura Family welcomed the guests with a banquet, the Mossack way. Plates and bowls full of exotic traditional foods were grouped and stacked on the floor, while the host and the guests would sitting cross-legged in circle.
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro was a hardcore Mossack. When his family’s fate hanged upon the balance, he believed a good talk and good food would solve any problem.
</p>
<p>
Even though Yashura Family was big, to show the sincerity of the host and to avoid the political atmosphere, for this occasion Patriarch Shuro decided the ones that humor the guests were only his close family--him, his wife, his sole daughter, and his nephew, Shira. Sir Barront Staterwind sat cross-legged on the opposite side, with his two disciples sat each beside him, and a servant gray-haired middle-aged man sat calmly behind them. Jerrin Yurin, the older one, was originally an extravert, the kind that could always conjure a conversion out of the trivialest things. So he drove the light talks around bountiful southern harvests and foods, a kind of talk that Patriarch Shuro particularly fond of. Besides learning about the designated third disciple, Jerrin and Merly also unexpectedly learned a lot about coconuts, thanks to Patriarch Shuro’s passionate knowledge in the field of coconuts.
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro was too carried away by the conversation that he seemingly didn’t realize the odd air happened beside him. His nephew, Shira, had a hard time on his own. The boy could feel the girl beside Sir Barront, who happened at the same age as Mila, scrutinized him with studying eyes. Occasionally, the talkative young man named Jerrin Yurin would directed a few questions toward him, he read the subtle nuance and also realized, within the few of those seemingly trivial questions, the man was actually trying to figure him out. Shira thought he answered the questions in a safe way. And Jerrin also seemed to see him as a harmless fifteen years old boy, as he lost his hidden alertness in his tone and began to chat normally with him. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, however, Shira didn’t see the supposed high status Nalaq. Either Sir Barront and his disciples didn’t plan to engage seriously this afternoon, or the mysterious Nalaq sat back with a wait and see attitude, but all this made Shira couldn’t help but think that the prospect for him to study with these folks wasn’t as sweet as his uncle Patriarch Shuro previously told him.
</p>
<p>
“I have a question for you,” Merly Yurin for the first time talked to Shira. The older folks who were enjoying a hearty chat then stopped and focused their attention to the girl.
</p>
<p>
“What questions do you have for me, Young Lady Yurin? I’ll answer the best I could.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it true that you are engaged to Bhela with surname of Malikh?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” Shira was taken aback a little bit. Since the other party asked about this topic, surely they knew about the ruckus that happened during Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony. “The whole thing was planned before even I could barely talk.”
</p>
<p>
“Ehem,” Patriarch Shuro cleared his phlegm, as he always knew this nephew of his always being too blunt whenever the topic of his engagement was brought out of the blue. “Young Lady Yurin, the thing is, Shira’s father and the patriarch of Malikh Family were as close as brothers, so when they each had a baby boy and a baby girl, they thought it was a good idea for Yashura and Malikh to be together.” The patriarch saw his well-thought explaining didn’t received well, thus awkwardly added, “That’s how it is, really. The engagement actually wasn’t a big deal before Patriarch Malikh’s daughter got chosen as a candidate to attend a fancy seminars backed by lots of royal families and big clans.”
</p>
<p>
“I did attend the fancy seminars you’re talking about, Patriarch Yashura,” Merly said, her tone was a bit sour. “I reckon everyone in this village knows her real worth by now. Even during the seminars, Bhela Malikh is a celebrity amongst the students. She has a real talent and she always worked hard to back it up.”
</p>
<p>
Shira smiled. Whenever that annoying topic came up, faking a smile was the only thing he could do.
</p>
<p>
“Honestly, I balked at how sloppy your current talent is,” Merly continued, “even if a boy coming from a very poor family, at least getting to Level 6 at your age isn’t really a problem. But you, a healthy fifteen years old, who is the heir of the village’s major family, is unable to even ascend to a mere Level 4 Novice--honestly, honestly…”
</p>
<p>
Merly took out a scroll from her sleeve. The Yashura Family wasn’t too surprised for the guests to investigate Shira, but to show it blatantly was really too much to bear. “I don’t know what to say about this,” Merly sighed. “Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> far outweigh your other attributes. People say Stats only are numbers when it comes to the realm of men and earth, and I think they have one thing correct about a high number of <strong>Wisdom</strong> doesn’t actually mean the person is wise. Not in this case, anyway. Have you ever considered how your position of an heir and a fiancé of well-known best talent of this generation? Coarse attributes like <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Agility </strong>are the easiest to raise, and the most effective way to level up--yet, after seeing your current <strong>Stats</strong> is, even the most ignorant one can see that you didn’t even try.”
</p>
<p>
The room fell silent. Patriarch Shuro Yashura opened his mouth, but closed before he made a sound. Even Mila, the one that first to defend her cousin during Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony, lowered her head, feeling embarrassed herself--Merly did poked at the right wound. Naturally Shira also was silent. He knew if he opened his mouth now, the only thing that he could say only lame excuses.
</p>
<p>
In the end, it was Patriarch Shuro’s wife who opened her mouth and explained, “This… Young Lady Yurin… it’s not like nephew Shira is too lazy to bother about it…”
</p>
<p>
“Cough, he is, a bit… cough…” Patriarch Shuro, who felt guilty about lying, murmured between his fake cough. His wife elbowed from the side, the patriarch then acted as if he didn’t say anything.
</p>
<p>
“Ever since Shira’s a baby he’s a bit too sensitive and can easily get sick,” Madam Yashura continued explaining for her nephew. “His mother left him the moment he was born, and at the time he couldn’t drink milk from wet nurses. There was an old doctor who Shira’s father brought from outside the village that always checked on him, and he said to stabilize Shira’s condition he needed to suppress his manasphere from being active--thus, his talent growth over the years hasn’t been very satisfying.” Madam Yashura sighed. “Remembering back all those years ago, honestly, it’s already a blessing that he’s still able to keep his life. He was pitiful, this kid…”
</p>
<p>
Shira unfortunately sat beside his aunt, he got his hair ruffled in a very embarrassing way. 
</p>
<p>
On the other side, Merly was silent as if she pondering, and Sir Barront quickly assured the family that Blue Robe Society regarded the contract with Nalaq more important than the students’ own talents. Jerrin, however, quietly glanced back from his shoulder, asking to verify the story from the person who had personally investigated the boy; Norman nodded his head telling something like that really did happen.
</p>
<p>
At this point, Shira knew his chances of being accepted was already screwed. He didn’t know the details, but he realized the girl, who happened to be the youngest of the guests, held even heftier voice than her own teacher--instead of apologizing to Yashura Family, Sir Baront would make the words that came out of her mouth nicer if that wasn’t the case.
</p>
<p>
A moment later, Merly continued with her sharp words as if she was numb to the awkward atmosphere. “If this boy has a disability, why that Nalaq chose him then?”
</p>
<p>
That, even Madam Yashura could only glance Shira with question mark.
</p>
<p>
Merly said, “Any Nalaq won’t choose any human without any redeeming quality to contract with. That is because the Nalaq will possess him after the contract ends, and will live in the human’s place until the mortal body rots. I have an outstanding affinity with fire elemental, enough to ensure me achieving Rank-3 Fire Mage in the future, but that only gives me 60 years worth of contract with my Nalaq, Mama Ross, who happened to be a great Fire Mage herself in the past,” Merly took a beat, looking straight at Shira’s eyes. “Surely, the Nalaq of yours sees something different in you that interested him. If you can convince us what’s so good about you, maybe Mama Ross will favor you a bit when she confronts this Nalaq.”
</p>
<p>
Shira didn’t like the girl’s tone. But he decided to reply her since he wanted to save some face for his uncle. However, the more he thought about it, the more mysterious it was to decipher Good-Natured Spirit’s thought. Why he came to Shira in the first place?
</p>
<p>
“Well…” Shira murmured.
</p>
<p>
“Well?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s because…” the only desire Good-Natured Spirit ever showed was worldly vulgar desire of women. Shira’s mind was thinking fast; Good-Natured Spirit was a ghost, so he couldn’t touch women unless he got a mortal body. Yet, a mere body wouldn’t make a womanizer Nalaq so desperate he willing to lose again and again waging countless games of chess. There ought something that made Good-Natured Spirit desperate to get him, and it had something to do with getting women with the mortal body of his. Finally, he reached a conclusion. “Maybe because I’m handsome?”
</p>
<p>
“COUGH!” Mila loudly faked a cough.
</p>
<p>
Her father and mother coughs followed suit.
</p>
<p>
“Cough cough cough!”
</p>
<p>
“Cough cough!”
</p>
<p>
“COUGH COUGH COUGH!!!”
</p>
<p>
Mila and her parents wanted to cover Shira’s lame answer with their coughing. But it was unlucky for them that the guests already heard it, loud and clear.
</p>
<p>
Even the cordial Sir Barront and his disciple Jerring didn’t know what to say. Meanwhile, Merly frowned, the previous charm she bore with her had gone as she sourly said, “Your confident is too much. You should’ve look yourself in front of a mirror.”
</p>
<p>
Shira had enough of this rude girl. He wasn’t this fed up when she stood in front of that unlikable young noble of Blackwood Family. For southern people, being taken lightly as a host was horrible, it was a common sense for Mossack descents scowled at ungrateful guests. This must how Bhela Malikh felt when Mila brazenly asking her to a duel in her own courtyard. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, frowning himself, Shira said with an impatient tone, “That was the only plausible answer I could give you based on my understanding of his personality. If you really wanted to know his reason too much, why don’t you go ask him yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“S-Shira!” Mila cried. She looked at he parents; Patriarch Shuro was pale. He decided to be silent, pretending as if he was a block of wood. Then, nervously, Mila glanced at the line of the esteemed guests, saw that Sir Barront sighed as he shook his head, Jerrin looked at Shira with a trace of pity, while Merly glared the boy with scornful eyes.
</p>
<p>
Merly said slowly as her eyes still locked on the youth, “This settles it. The one that approaches you isn’t a proper Nalaq--he isn’t even a low-ranked one.”
</p>
<p>
Shira raised his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
“If it was a proper Nalaq,” Merly continued, “then you should’ve realized you’re talking to another one by now.”
</p>
<p>
After Merly said that, she lowered her head, closing her eyes, seemingly fell into a sudden slumber. Mystical smoke puffed out behind her back, slowly condensed into an ethereal womanly figure. A face formed, she was exceedingly beautiful, and she was frowning; she had the same scornful gaze at Shira Yashura.
</p>
<p>
“Greeting, Venerable Madame Ross!” Sir Barront Staterwind was the first one to prostate and gave his greeting. Jerrin also turned to face Mama Ross and began prostrating.
</p>
<p>
Seeing the guests reaction, Patriarch Shuro who already gave up his hope on his nephew’s prospect was startled. It took a beat for him to realize his nephew had done much more damage than getting his chance of accepted as Sir Barront’s disciple.

<p>
“I am very sorry for my nephew’s impudence, Venerable Madame Nalaq!” Patriarch Shuro cried as soon as he slammed his forehead upon the mat covered floor, prostrating submissively. “Please don’t punish my ignorant nephew, if you wanted to punish someone then please punish this old me!”
</p>
<p>
“No!” beside him, his daughter Mila Yashura slammed her forehead harder. “My father done no wrong! It was me who failed to guide my younger cousin even though I have the chances! It was me! It was me who was responsible! Please punish just me!”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro raised his head in disbelief; tears welled in his eyes as he gazed at the prostrating figure of his stubborn daughter. “Mila… what are you saying?” his voice was trembling, “the responsibility for guiding a youngster falls to his own parents and guardians only… you’ve done no wrong, daughter…”
</p>
<p>
His eyes filled absolute decision; he was a father, an uncle, and the sole patriarch of Yashura Family. It was him who was supposed to take the whole responsibility.
</p>
<p>
BAM!
</p>
<p>
“I’m the one who was wrong!” Patriarch Shuro cried so loud that his voice echoed inside the family hall. “Please punish me as you see fit!”
</p>
<p>
As his forehead kissed the floor mat, Patriarch Shuro closed his eyes, waiting for the hammer of punishment descend upon him. However--
</p>
<p>
BAAM!
</p>
<p>
Mila’s cry shrieked even louder than her father’s. “My father is stupid! The only knowledge he ever bestowed upon my ignorant cousin is useless trivia about damned coconuts! He’s not fit to guide anyone! It was me who supposed to guide Shira! But I failed! So please punish me!”
</p>
<p>
BAAAMM!!
</p>
<p>
“No, punish me!” Patriarch Shuro urged.
</p>
<p>
BAAM!
</p>
<p>
“No, me!” Mila cried. 
</p>
<p>
BAMM!!!
</p>
<p>
“My daughter is confused, I’m the one who’s wrong!”
</p>
<p>
BAAM!
</p>
<p>
“Confused is better than being stupid! You’ll feel better if you’re just punish me!”
</p>
<p>
Beside the ceaseless yelling, Madam Yashura also prostrating with her body trembling. Shira, although also prostrating himself, was calm like a stone in turbulent lake--it was impossible to read what was inside the head of his.
</p>
<p>
Mama Ross originally didn’t care about this Yashura Family. But after seeing blood trickled on Mila’s forehead, Mama Ross sighed. The girl was the same age as her Merly Yurin. She couldn’t watch this stupid scene any longer. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, with a wave of her hand, she said, “Stop! I don’t plan to punish anyone.”
</p>
<p>
Slowly, both Patriarch Shuro and Mila raised their heads, peeking nervously at Mama Ross’s mood.
</p>
<p>
“It’s okay if Madame Ross said so,” in the end, it was Sir Baront’s words that made the pair father and daughter at ease.
</p>
<p>
Mama Ross said, “When I’m still alive, the Mossack chiefs all had self-respect and would never beg others to punish themselves. I don’t know what had happened in these two thousand years, time sure regress man’s nature.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m ashamed of my immature conduct,” Patriarch Shuro said, with his head lowered and his voice almost whimpering like a guilty puppy, “please do forgive this unworthy descendant of Mossack people…”
</p>
<p>
“Stop that self-mockery. I don’t want to hear it anymore,” Mama Ross snorted. He then looked at the other members of Yashura Family who still prostrating on the floor. “More important… lift your heads, all of you.”
</p>
<p>
Shira and his aunt raised their heads.
</p>
<p>
Mama Ross said to Shira, “I see how awkward you are, child. You’re not familiar in greeting a Nalaq. That’s more evident for Staterwind’s wrong about the Nalaq with you is a low-ranked one, not to mention the fact that he’s afraid in meeting a proper high-ranked Nalaq like me.”
</p>
<p>
Shira said nothing as he listened to Mama Ross’s prideful voice. As his family knew the existence of Good-Natured Spirit and knew that he was not so good-natured, though he didn’t know what would happen next, he knew for sure that he wouldn’t be able to exploit Good-Natured Spirit’s wallet from those chess games. This revelation saddened him greatly. 
</p>
<p>
While Mama Ross was rubbing the back of Merly’s neck, who slowly woken up from her daze because the possession before, the Nalaq caught the flash of regret in the Shira’s face.
</p>
<p>
“I'm one of the few that responsible of many orders during the rebirth era of Tiramikal Continent,” Mama Ross said. “So I suppose I’ll help you if that rogue Nalaq really did make troubles. Consider this the payment for this afternoon meal and your hospitality.”
</p>
<p>
Sir Barront Staterwind immediately said to Yashura Family, “Madame Ross is one of the pillars that oversaw Tiramikal Continent’s rebuilding after the Great Rebellion two thousands years ago--so she cares common people greatly. Sir Patriarch Yashura, quickly say your thanks to Madame Ross!”
</p>
<p>
As if it was a competition, Patriarch Shuro and his daughter Mila threw their into the floor and yelled both at the same time, “Thank you very much, Venerable Madame Ross!”
</p>
<p>
Shira and his aunt followed after, but their responses weren’t as excited as the pair of father and daughter.
</p>
<p>
Merly was swaying in her sitting, Mama Ross then hugged her onto her chest. The lady Nalaq accepted the Yashura Family’s gratefulness with only a glance in the corner of her eyes--the scene of an ethereal spirit holding a girl dearly seemed picturesque, leaving the onlookers felt a hint of warmness inside them. Shira remembered Good-Natured Spirit had said that the only Nalaqs that could easily interact with living object and human beings were those with ridiculously high level talent in their real life--if two kinds of personalities like Good-Natured Spirit and Sir Baront Staterwind said the same thing, he reckon it must be true.
</p>
<p>
“It seems Merly’s body still hasn’t adapted with temporary possession,” Mama Ross murmured, then she said without turning her eyes away from the girl, “Jerrin, you look somewhere for us to do combat training, this village must have somewhere good for us to train our sync.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Madame Ross,” Jerrin Yurin eagerly replied. Although he was supposed to be Merly’s elder disciple and her older cousin, in reality, all he was doing these past month was accompanying and taking care Merly while she adapting with Mama Ross’s temporary possession--a technique of which developed quite sophisticatedly by Blue Robe Society.
</p>
<p>
“Staterwind, Norman.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Madame Ross?” Sir Barront and the coach and bodyguard for the Yurins waited for the order.
</p>
<p>
“That rogue Nalaq must’ve been hiding now that I can’t feel his presence. Go look for his whereabouts!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes!!”
</p>
<p>
Patriarch Shuro and his family felt nervous when he witnessed how decisive it looked when the lady Nalaq gave her orders. Especially the patriarch, although his looks seemed fierce like he was long engaged in banditry, this man couldn’t keep his calm and felt groveling on his knees was the more right thing to do. 
</p>
<p>
“Umm…” Only Shira who looked awkward, like he had something to say.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, boy?” Mama Ross asked sharply as her hands patting Merly’s head.
</p>
<p>
“I think that rogue Nalaq will meet you… Venerable Madame Ross…”
</p>
<p>
“Oh? I’m being told that Nalaq doesn’t want to see me. What makes you think differently?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Young Master Yashura began to see Madame Ross’s greatness,” Sir Baront Staterwind musing on the side.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’m now sure the rogue Nalaq will be awed by Madame Ross’s greatness.”
</p>
<p>
Shira lifted his head slightly, stealing a glance with a covertly manner. He didn’t see clearly before afraid he’d being rude, but now, he could see the picture of a girl comfortably resting her head on two great melon pillows.
</p>
<p>
After they had lunch together they decided to take a break on the meeting. After vaguely praising the lady Nalaq for her big, great assets, Shira being tasked to fetch for Good-Natured and see if he could make the two Nalaq meet. The boy didn’t search him for too long since he was familiar with the spots where the Nalaq hung out alone to smoke his cigarettes.
</p>
<p>
“Good-For-Nothing Spirit.”
</p>
<p>
“Yo, what’s up, kiddo?”
</p>
<p>
“The Nalaq I told you is in the family, now. She said she wants to meet you.”
</p>
<p>
“Is this a high-ranking Nalaq you’re talking about?”
</p>
<p>
“She said you’re a rogue Nalaq.”
</p>
<p>
“Fuck no, no,” Good-Natured Spirit waved his hand, saying, “I don’t believe any this Nalaq worshipping bullshit. Anyone who calls themselves <em>proper</em> Nalaq is dead idiots with superiority complex who thinks they’re better because their names appeared in some fucking history books that practically no one read--the picture of you ignorant people grovelling everytime a Nalaq shows themselves is a puke-worthy sight to see. Fuck, don’t count me for this nonsense man. I’m outta here.”
</p>
<p>
He stood up and began to float away.
</p>
<p>
It seemed Good-Natured Spirit didn’t really like his kinds. But Shira already made a promise bringing him in front of Mama Ross; as the young master of Yashura Family, how could he bailed on his own words now?
</p>
<p>
Shira’s expression thus became solemn.
</p>
<p>
He said, “She’s got melons.”
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit slowing down.
</p>
<p>
“She’s got big boobs and big butts,” Shira said again.
</p>
<p>
Good-Natured Spirit changed his course a total one-hundred-eighty degrees. “The fuck you’re dilly-dallying about? A lady’s waiting. Lead the way!”
</p>
